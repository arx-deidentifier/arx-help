    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>When a potentially suitable transformation has been selected, this perspective can be utilized to compare the
        transformed data set to the original input data set. In the center, this perspective will display the original data
        (area 1) and a transformation (area 2). Both tables are synchronized, e.g., when
        they are browsed using the horizontal or vertical scrollbars. The areas 3 and 4, allow to compare statistical
        information about the currently selected attribute(s).</p>

    <p>The checkboxes indicate, which rows are contained in the research subset. The checkboxes in the view for the
        result data set, indicate the subset that was configured when the anonymization process was performed. They cannot be
        edited. The checkboxes in the view for the input data set represent the current research subset and can thus be
        edited.</p>
    <p>Each data view offers a few options, that are accessible via buttons in the top-right corner of the data view:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first button will sort the data according to the currently selected column</li>
        <li>The second button will sort the output data set according to all quasi-identifiers and then highlight
            the equivalence classes</li>
        <li>The third button will toggle whether all rows of the data set are displayed or only the current research
            subset</li>
    </ol>
