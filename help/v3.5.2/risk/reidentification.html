    <h4>Re-identification risks</h4>
    <p>This view displays an overview of several measures for re-identification risks implemented by ARX. In the upper area
       of this perspective, risk estimates are provided for three different attacker models: (1) the prosecutor scenario, (2) the
       journalist scenario and (3) the marketer scenario. In the prosecutor model it is assumed that the attacker already knows
       that data about the targeted individual is contained in the data set. In the journalist model, such background knowledge is not assumed.
       In the marketer model, it is assumed that the attacker is not interested in re-identifying a specific individual but that she 
       aims at attacking a larger number of individuals. An attack can therefore only be considered successful if a larger
       portion of the records could be re-identified.</p>
    <p>Thresholds can be provided for the highest risk of any record, the records that have a risk higher than this threshold and
       for the average proportion of records that can successfully be re-identified.
       More details about the methods implemented by ARX can be found in the book   
       <em>Guide to the De-Identification of Personal Health Information</em> by Khaled el Emam.</p>

    <p>In the lower part of the screen, selected measures of prosecutor re-identification risks are displayed. These 
       measures are based on the sample itself. They are complemented by numbers on population uniqueness from a selected
       statistical model:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lowest prosecutor re-identification risk.</li>
        <li>Individuals affected by lowest risk.</li>
        <li>Highest prosecutor re-identification risk.</li>
        <li>Individuals affected by highest risk.</li>
        <li>Average prosecutor re-identification risk.</li>
        <li>Fraction of unique records.</li>
    </ul>
