    <h4>Properties of output data</h4>
    <p>This section displays basic properties about the output data set. 
       These properties include the number of suppressed records, the number of equivalence classes and the number of classes containing outliers, 
       data utility and privacy guarantees. Note that this information represents the specification that has been defined in the configuration 
       perspective prior to performing the anonymization process. The state of the workbench will remain unchanged, even if these definitions are 
       changed. To incorporate changes (e.g., adjusted generalization hierarchies) into the exploration and utility analysis perspectives, the 
       data de-identification process needs to be executed again.</p>
