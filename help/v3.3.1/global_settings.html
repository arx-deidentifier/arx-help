    <h4>Project settings</h4>
    <p>The settings window is accessible from either the application menu or the application toolbar. The <em>Project</em>
       section allows to alter general project properties, including the syntax for
       importing and exporting data.</p>

    <p>The <em>Internals</em> section allows to adjust some parameters of the optimizations employed by ARX.
        Changing the <em>number of snapshots</em> enables users to control a space-time-tradeoff used during data de-identification.
        Choosing a value of <em>1</em> greatly reduces the main memory requirements of the tool, while leading to
        potentially significantly increased execution times. Choosing a larger value will reduce execution times, but
        increase memory consumption. The default value is <em>200</em>.
        Finally, this are allows to control the visualizations of the solution space in the exploration perspective.</p>
     <p>The section <em>Transformation</em> provides options for altering
        aspects of the data transformations that are performed by ARX. First, it can be specified which types of attributes are to be masked
        in records that are outliers. The <em>suppression string</em> is used as a masking character.</p>
     <p>In the section <em>Search method</em> the maximal size of the search space can be specified. If this size is exceed
        a heuristic search will be performed. The heuristic search process will again be termined after a user-defined amount
        of time. When a risk-based de-identification process is performed, ARX can either suppress records based on the sizes
        of their equivalence classes or use the utility measure for this purpose.</p>
     <p>In the <em>Utility analysis</em> section, users can control properties of the summary statistics computed by ARX
        and specify whether functional representations of generalization hierarchies should be used for computing data utility.
        Moreover, some aspects of the logistic regression classification algorithm implemented by ARX can be specified.</p> 
     <p>The section <em>Risk analysis</em> allows defining parameters of the Newton-Raphson method used for solving bivariate
        non-linear equation systems when evaluating population-based risk models. Parameter include the total number of iterations, 
        iterations per try and the required accuracy.
