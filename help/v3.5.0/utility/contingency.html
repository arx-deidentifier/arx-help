    <h4>Contingency</h4>
    <p>This area shows a heat map or a table visualizing the contingency of two selected attributes.</p>
    <p>From Wikipedia: In statistics, a contingency table is a type of table in a matrix format that displays the multivariate frequency distribution of the variables.</p>

    <p>Note: ARX tries to present comparable data visualizations of properties of the original and transformed data sets. For this purpose, it
       uses information from the attributes' data types and relationships between its values, which are extracted from the
       generalization hierarchies. As a consequence, specifying reasonable data types and hierarchies will increase the quality
       and comparability of data visualizations.</p>
