    <h4>Transformation and utility model</h4>
    <p>In the first tab of this view, general properties of the transformation process can be specified.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.6.0/img/configuration/general_1.png" alt="General" width="316" height="82" />
    <p>The first slider allows to define the suppression limit, which is the maximal number of outliers that can be tolerated in the de-identified
       data set. Records that are outliers will be removed from the data set.
       <strong>The recommended value for this parameter is "100%"</strong>. The option "Approximate" can be enabled to compute an approximate solution 
       with potentially significantly reduced execution times. The solution is guaranteed to fulfill the given privacy 
       model, but it might not be optimal. <strong>The recommended setting is "off"</strong>. For some utility measures, 
       e.g. Non-Uniform Entropy and Loss, precomputation can be enabled, which may also significantly reduced execution times.
       Precomputation is switched on when, for each quasi-identifier, the number of distinct data values divided by the total number of records 
       in the data set is lower than the configured threshold. Experiments have shown that 0.3 is often a good value for this parameter. 
       <strong>The recommended setting is "on"</strong>.</p>
    <p>The second tab allows specifying the measure that is to be used for estimating data utility.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.6.0/img/configuration/general_2.png" alt="Utility" width="316" height="82" />
    <p>ARX will display data quality / utility in terms of "scores". A lower score means higher data quality, lower loss of information
       of higher publisher payout, depending on the selected quality model.
       ARX currently supports the following models:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Ambiguity.</li>
        <li>Height.</li>
        <li>Precision.</li>
        <li>Average equivalence class size.</li>
        <li>Discernibility.</li>
        <li>Non-uniform entropy.</li>
        <li>Normalized non-uniform entropy.</li>
        <li>KL divergence.</li>
        <li>Loss.</li>
        <li>Publisher payout.</li>
        <li>Entropy-based record-level information loss.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Monotonicity is a property of privacy models and utility measures than can be exploited to make the
       de-identification process more efficient. In real-world settings, privacy models and utility measures are only rarely monotonic. 
       ARX can be configured to always assume monotonicity, which will speed-up the 
       de-identification process significantly but which may reduce the quality of output data. <strong>The recommended setting is "off"</strong>.
       Since version 2.3. ARX also supports user-defined aggregate functions for many measures. These aggregate
       functions are used to compile the utility estimates obtained for the individual attributes of a data set into a global value.
       <strong>The recommended setting is "Arithmetic mean"</strong>. ARX currently supports the following aggregate functions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Maximum.</li>
        <li>Sum.</li>
        <li>Arithmetic mean.</li>
        <li>Geometric mean.</li>
        <li>Rank.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some utility models also support considering the effect of microaggregation on data quality. If supported, it can
    be specified whether the mean squared error or a simple notion of information loss should be included.</p>
    <p>For most measures, attributes may be weighted as is shown in the following screen shot.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.6.0/img/configuration/general_3.png" alt="Weights" width="316" height="82" />
    <p>Each of the knobs may be used to associated a weight to a specific quasi-identifier. When de-identifying a
       data set, ARX will try to reduce the loss of information for attributes with higher weights.</p>
    <p>If "Loss" has been selected for measuring data utility, the coding model may also be further specified in an additional tab.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.6.0/img/configuration/general_4.png" alt="Coding model" width="316" height="82" />
    <p>With the slider it can be configured whether ARX should prefer generalization or suppression for de-identifying the data set.</p>
