    <h3>Comparing data (Area 3 &amp; 4)</h3>
    <h4>Properties of the input dataset and the anonymized dataset</h4>
    <p>ARX tries to present comparable data visualizations for original and transformed datasets. To this end, it
        uses information from the attributes' data types and relationships between values extracted from the
        generalization hierarchies. As a result, specifying meaningful types and hierarchies will increase the quality
        and comparability of data visualizations.</p>
    <p>The first tab in this view shows the summary statistics about the data values of the currently selected
        column.</p>

    <p>The second and the third tab shows the distribution of values of the currently selected column. The second
        one as a bar plot, the third tab as a tabular representation of the frequency distribution.</p>

    <p>The fourth and fifth tabs showing the contingency of the two currently selected attributes. The fourth tab
        shows a heatmap, whereas the fifth tab shows the data as a table.</p>

    <h4>Properties of the selected transformation</h4>
    <p>The last tab displays basic properties about the applied transformation. For the input dataset these
        properties include, the number of tuples and the maximum number of allowed outliers and a shallow specification
        of all attributes in the dataset. Further properties are displayed for the transformed dataset. These include
        the actual number of outliers, the number of equivalence classes and the number of outlying classes, the
        information loss and the resulting privacy guarantees. Note that these information represent the specification
        that has been defined in the data definition perspective before the anonymization has been performed. The state
        of the workbench will remain unchanged, even if these definitions are changed. To incorporate changes (e.g.,
        adjusted generalization hierarchies) into the data exploration and data analysis perspectives, the data needs to
        be anonymized again.</p>
