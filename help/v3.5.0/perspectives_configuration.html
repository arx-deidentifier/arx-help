    <p>In this perspective, first, a data set can be imported into the tool and attribute meta data can be specified,
       including data types and attribute properties in terms of privacy risks.
       Second, generalization hierarchies for quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes can be created
       semi-automatically with built-in wizards or imported into the tool from CSV files. Third, privacy models, the method for
       measuring data utility and further parameters, which control the transformation process, can be
       specified.</p>
