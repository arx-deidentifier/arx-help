    <h4>Finding quasi-identifiers</h4>
    <p>In this view, combinations of attributes can be analyzed regarding associated risks of re-identification.
       The view provides information about the degree to which combinations of variables separate the records from each other
       and to which degree the variables make records distinct.
       First, a set of attributes must be selected for further analysis in the bottom left area.</p>
