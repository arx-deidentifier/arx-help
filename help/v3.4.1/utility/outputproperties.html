    <h4>Properties of output data</h4>
    <p>This section displays basic properties about the selected data transformation as well as the resulting output data set. 
       These properties include the information loss according to the specified utility measure, the 
       number of suppressed records, the number of equivalence classes and the number of classes containing outliers.
       If the transformation is privacy-preserving, a complete specification of all fulfilled privacy models is provided.</p>

    <p>Note: The information provided in this view is based on the specification which has been defined in the configuration 
       perspective prior to performing the de-identification process. The state of the workbench will remain unchanged, even if these definitions are 
       changed. To incorporate changes (e.g., adjusted generalization hierarchies) into the exploration and utility analysis perspectives, the 
       data de-identification process needs to be executed again.</p>
