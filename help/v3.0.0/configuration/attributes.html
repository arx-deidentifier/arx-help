    <h3>Attributes and generalization hierarchies (area 2)</h3>
    <p>This area allows to assign attribute types and data types to columns and to specify the generalization hierarchies
        for quasi-identifying and sensitive attributes. As shown
        in area 2.1, each tab is associated to one attribute of the input dataset. The dropdown list in area 2.2
        supports specifying the type of the attribute, whereas the dropdown list in area 2.3 allows to
        specify a data type. Specifying a data type is optional but yields better results when creating generalization
        hierarchies via ARX's built-in wizard and when visualizing data properties in the analysis perspective. While
        ARX will happily treat all data as strings, please note that specifying a data type can be important for
        generating meaningful generalization hierarchies and having a more intuitive graphical representation of data
        properties in the analysis perspective. Currently, the following data types are supported:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>String: a generic sequence of characters. This is the default data type.</li>
        <li>Integer: a data type for numbers without a fractional component.</li>
        <li>Decimal: a data type for numbers with fractional component.</li>
        <li>Date/Time: a data type for dates and timestamps.</li>
        <li>Ordered string: this data type represents strings with ordinal scale.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Some data types require a format string, which can be specified in area 2.4. Integers and
        dates/timestamps are typical examples. More information on format strings for decimals can be found <a
            title="Decimal format" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html"
            target="_blank">here</a> and information on format strings for dates/timestamps can be found <a
            title="Date format" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html"
            target="_blank">here</a>.

    <p>Area 2.5 displays a tabular representation of the associated generalization hierarchy, if there is any. The
        values from the original input dataset are shown in the first column and the level of generalization increases
        from left to right. This area also implements a basic editor for generalization hierarchies, which allows to
        move, add and delete columns or rows and to alter the labels of individual cells. Please note that the defined
        generalization hierarchy must be monotonic (meaning that it must resemble a tree structure), otherwise ARX
        will abort with an error message when anonymizing data. As a starting point for defining generalization
        hierarchies, the tool offers a wizard, which is able to create generalization hierarchies for many common types
        of attributes. The wizard can be launched via the application menu or via an associated button in the
        application toolbar. The drop-down lists in area 2.6 allows specifying minimal and maximal generalization
        levels for the selected attribute.</p>
