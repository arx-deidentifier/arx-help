    <h4>Local recoding</h4>
    <p>This section allows to perform local recoding to further enhance data utility. 
       It is recommended to start with favoring suppression over generalization, which can be achieved by moving the slider to the left, and then to perform a 
       fixpoint-adaptive recoding process with a parameter of 0.05.</p>

    <p>ARX will perform local recoding by recursively executing a global recoding method on all records that have been suppressed
       in the previous iteration. With this method, a significant improvement in homogeneity and data utility can be achieved compared
       to other local recoding algorithms. Moreover, the method supports various privacy models, including models against
       attribute disclosure.</p>
