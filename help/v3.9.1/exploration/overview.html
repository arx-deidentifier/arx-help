    <h4>4. Exploring the solution space</h4>
    <p>In this perspective, the solution space can be browsed and transformations can be applied to the input dataset.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.9.1/img/exploration/overview.png" alt="Exploration view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>In area 1 a subset of the current solution space is displayed. The transformations which are shown here 
       can be selected by using filters that are provided in area 2. Area 3 implements a clip board in which transformations
       can be stored and annotated, while area 4 displays properties of the currently selected transformation.</p>
    <p>Apart from some shortcuts to menu entries, ARX's application toolbar also displays some information from this
       perspective: (1) the currently <em>selected</em> transformation, (2) the currently <em>applied</em>
       transformation as well as some statistics collected during the anonymization process. These statistics include 
       the number of privacy-preserving transformations and the total number of transformations in
       the solution space as well as some statistics about the search process.</p>
    <p>Each transformation is identified by the generalization levels which it specifies for the quasi-identifiers in the input dataset.</p>
    <p>Please note that since version 3.7.0 ARX supports a local transformation method which applies different
    transformation schemes to different parts of the input dataset. In this case, the exploration perspective
    displays the individual transformations applied to the dataset.</p>
