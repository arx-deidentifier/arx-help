    <p>The  screen shot shows the clip board available for organizing and annotating transformations. Right-clicking an
       entry opens up a context menu, which allows to remove the transformation, apply it to the current data set and to
       edit its annotations. The buttons in the upper right area support removing all entries, changing their order
       and sorting them according to the resulting reductions in data utility.</p>
