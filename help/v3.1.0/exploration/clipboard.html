    <p>The figure shows the clipboard available for organizing and annotating transformations. Right-clicking an
        entry opens up a context menu, which allows to remove the transformation, apply it to the current dataset and to
        edit its annotations. The buttons in the upper right area support removing all entries, changing their order
        and sorting them according to their associated loss in data utility.</p>
