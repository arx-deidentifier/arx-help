    <h4>Organizing transformations</h4>
    <p>This view contains a clipboard, which can be used to organize and annotate transformations. Right-clicking an
       entry opens up a context menu, which allows to remove the transformation, apply it to the current dataset and to
       edit its annotations.</p>
    <img src="../img/ch4-exploration/p0403_01_clipboard.png" alt="Clipboard" width="568" height="238" /> 
    <p>The buttons in the upper right corner support removing the selected entry, changing its order,
       and sorting the entries according to the resulting reductions in data utility.</p>
    <p>Please note that since version 3.7.0 ARX supports a local transformation method which applies different
       transformation schemes to different parts of the input dataset. If this option is used, this view will be
       disabled.</p>
