    <h4>Summary statistics</h4>
    <p>The first tab on the bottom of the utility analysis perspective shows summary statistics for the 
       currently selected attribute.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/utility/analyze_11.png" alt="Summary statistics" width="575" height="276" />
    <p>The displayed parameters depend on the scale of measure of the variable. 
       For attributes with a nominal scale, the following parameters will be provided:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mode</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For attributes with an ordinal scale, the following additional parameters will be displayed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Median, minimum, maximum</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For attributes with an interval scale, the following additional parameters will be provided:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Arithmetic mean, sample variance, population variance, standard deviation, range, kurtosis.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For attributes with a ratio scale, the following additional parameters will be displayed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Geometric mean</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: These statistical parameters are calculated using <em>list-wise deletion</em>, which is a method for handling missing data. 
       With this method, an entire record is excluded from analysis if any single value is missing. This behavior can
       be change in the project settings.</p>
