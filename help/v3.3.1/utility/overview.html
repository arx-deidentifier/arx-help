    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>When a solution candidate has been selected, this perspective can be used to evaluate its utility for the anticipated usage
       scenario. For this purpose, it is possible to compare the transformed data set to the original input data set. 
       In the center, this perspective will display the original data (area 1) and the result of the selected transformation (area 2). 
       Both tables are synchronized when they are browsed using the horizontal or vertical scroll bars. The areas 3 and 4, allow to 
       compare statistical information about the currently selected attribute(s).</p>

    <p>The check boxes indicate, which rows are part of the research sample. The check boxes in the table displaying the
        output data set, indicate the sample that was selected when the de-identification process was performed. They cannot be
        altered. The check boxes in the table displaying the input data set represent the current research sample. They are editable.</p>
    <p>Each table offers a few options, that are accessible via buttons in the top-right corner of the view:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pressing the first button will sort the data according to the currently selected attribute.</li>
        <li>Pressing the second button will sort the output data set according to all quasi-identifiers and then highlight
            the equivalence classes.</li>
        <li>Pressing the third button will toggle whether all records of the data set are displayed or only the current research sample.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The view further displayes results of univariate and bivariate statistics and basic properties about the input and output data set.
       Moreover, it provides access to statistics about the distribution of equivalence classes and the suppressed records. Finally,
       classification accuracy can be analyzed with a generic logistic regression method.</p>
    <p>ARX tries to present comparable data visualizations for original and transformed data sets. To this end, it
       uses information from the attributes' data types and relationships between values extracted from the
       generalization hierarchies. As a result, specifying reasonable data types and hierarchies will increase the quality
       and comparability of data visualizations.</p>
