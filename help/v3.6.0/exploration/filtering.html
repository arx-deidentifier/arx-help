    <h4>Filtering the solution space</h4>
    <p>The  screen shot shows controls for filtering the subset of the solution space that will be displayed in this perspective. First, a
       quasi-identifier can be selected and transformations can be restricted to ones defining the selected generalization levels for the 
       selected quasi identifier. Second, the displayed transformations can be restricted to
       transformations that do or do not preserve privacy according to the specified privacy model.</p>

    <p>The sliders at the bottom allow to display only
       transformations with a score that is in between the configured bounds. Note that
       the scores of transformations which have not been checked explicitly are not known and that they are
       therefore estimated with bounding intervals that are computed from other solutions in the search space.
       These estimates might be wrong when a heuristic de-identification process has been performed.</p>
