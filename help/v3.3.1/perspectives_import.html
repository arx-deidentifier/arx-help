    <h4>Import and export of data</h4>
    <p>Generalization hierarchies and data sets can be imported and exported from and to files containing character
       separated values (CSV). This allows to exchange data with common tools such as spreadsheet programs. For loading data
       into ARX, further data sources are supported. This includes MS Excel spreadsheets and data from relational
       database systems, such as MS SQL, DB2, MySQL or PostgreSQL. Data import can be performed with a dedicated wizard,
       which is shown in the following image.</p>

    <p>Apart from providing access to different types of data sources, this wizard also supports renaming, removing and ordering columns.
       Data types are automatically detected and data cleansing may be performed. This means that values that do not conform to the 
       selected data type will be replaced with null value, which are handled correctly by all methods provided in the ARX tool.</p>
