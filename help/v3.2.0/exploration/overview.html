    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this perspective, the solution space can be browsed and transformations can be applied to the input
        data set. The following figure shows an overview of this perspective. In area 1 a subset of the current
        generalization lattice is displayed. The transformations which are contained in this subset, can be selected by changing
        several filters that are provided by area 2. Area 3 implements a clipboard in which nodes can be stored and
        annotated, while area 4 displays properties of the currently selected transformation.</p>

        Apart from some shortcuts to menu entries, the application toolbar also displays some information from this
        perspective. These include the currently <em>selected</em> transformation, the currently <em>applied</em>
        transformation and some statistics regarding the current solution space. A transformation is
        identified by the generalization levels that it defines for the quasi-identifiers in the input data set.
        The currently <em>selected</em> transformation is the last transformation which the user has selected in the
        generalization lattice (area 1). If a solution exists for the current configuration, the currently selected
        transformation will initially be the global optimum. The currently <em>applied</em> transformation is the
        transformation that is currently displayed in the analysis perspective of the tool. Additionally, 
        the toolbar displays the number of anonymous transformations and the total number of transformations in
        the solution space as well as some statistics about the previous search process.
