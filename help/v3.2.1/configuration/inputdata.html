    <h4>Viewing and manipulating data (area 1)</h4>
    <p>This area displays the current input data set. The attribute types are depicted via different colors in the
        column headers:</p>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Red indicates an identifying attribute</li>
            <li>Yellow indicates a quasi-identifying attribute</li>
            <li>Purple indicates a sensitive attribute</li>
            <li>Green indicates an insensitive attribute</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>The checkboxes indicate, which rows have been selected for inclusion into the research data set. The
        checkboxes in the view for output data sets, indicate the subset that was defined when the anonymization process was
        last executed. They cannot be edited. The checkboxes in the view for the input data set represent the current
        research data set.</p>

    <p>Each table offers a few options that are accessible via buttons in the top-right corner of the view:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first button enables sorting the data according to the currently selected column</li>
        <li>The second button will sort the output data set according to all quasi-identifiers and then highlight
            the equivalence classes</li>
        <li>The third button will toggle between showing all records of the data set or only the currently selected research
            subset</li>
    </ol>
</div>
