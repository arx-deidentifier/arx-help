    <h4>Overview of ARX's perspectives</h4>
    <p>ARX is divided into four perspectives, which model different aspects of the
       anonymization process. As is shown below, these perspectives support 1) configuring privacy
       models, utility measures and transformation methods, 2) exploring the solution space, 3) analyzing data utility and
       4) analyzing privacy risks.</p>

    <p>In the configuration perspective, input data can be loaded, transformation rules can be specified
       and all further parameters, such as privacy models and utility measures, can be selected and parameterized. 
       If required, this step can be prepared by performing a risk analysis.</p>
    <p>After the anonymization process, an overview of potential solutions can be inspected in the exploration perspective.
       Here, it is possible to search for privacy-preserving data transformations, which result in output data that is suited
       for the intended usage scenario. Please note that ARX will also automatically propose a solution.</p>
    <p>To assess the usefulness of output data, the utility analysis perspective provides methods for comparing transformed data to 
       input data using information loss models, descriptive statistics and application-specific analyses, e.g. focusing on machine
       learning tasks.</p>
    <p>In the fourth perspective, privacy risks can be analyzed for input dataset as well as transformed output data.
       Based on the results of these analyses, the suitability of a solution candidate may either be confirmed or the 
       parameters of the anonymization process can be modified, resulting in a semi-automated workflow.</p>
