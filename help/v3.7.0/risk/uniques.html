    <h4>Population uniqueness</h4>
 	<p>ARX supports the estimation of re-identification risks based on the number of population uniques in a sample.
 	   Population uniques are records that are unique within the sample (sample uniques) and which are also unique within the
 	   underlying population from which the data has been samples. Note: Not all sample uniques are also population uniques.
 	   When no data about the population has been loaded into ARX in the form of a population table, this number can be 
 	   estimated with statistical models. Super-population models estimate the characteristics of the overall population with 
 	   probability distributions that are parameterized with sample characteristics. ARX supports 
       the methods by Hoshino (Pitman), Zayatz and Chen and McNulty (SNB).</p>
    <p>Different models may return differently accurate estimates of the number of population uniques. As a rule of thumb,
       the Pitman model should be used for sampling fractions lower than or equal to 10%. ARX also implements a
       decision rule proposed and validated for clinical data sets by Dankar et al. More information can be found here 
       (<em>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/12/66</em>).</p>
    <p>The tool also provides a perspective for comparing the results of different methods under the assumption of different
       sampling fractions:</p>

    <p>This view displays the estimates by the method of Dankar et al., again, for different sampling
       fractions:</p>

    <p>In the process of computing estimates with statistical models ARX must solve non-linear bivariate equation systems.
       The solver used by ARX can be configured in the settings dialog. Here, you may specify options such as the total
       number of iterations, iterations per try and the required accuracy etc. Changing these settings may influence the 
       precision of the results and the time required to obtain them.</p>
    <p>Note: Methods for estimating population uniqueness assume that the data set is a uniform sample of the population.
       If this is not the case, results may be inaccurate.</p>
