    <h4>Classes and records</h4>
    <p>This view summarizes information about the records in the data set. It shows the minimal, maximal and average size of the
    equivalence classes, the number of classes and the number of remaining records as well as the number of suppressed records.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/utility/analyze_7.png" alt="Equivalence classes" width="576" height="151" /> 
    <p>For the output data set, all parameters are calculated in two variants. One variant considers suppressed records and the
    other variant ignores suppressed records.</p> 
    <p>Note: The variant that ignores suppressed records uses listwise deletion, which is a method for handling missing data. 
       In this method, an entire record is excluded from analysis if any single value is missing.</p>
