    <h4>Local recoding</h4>
    <p>This section allows to perform local recoding to further enhance data utility. 
       It is recommended to start with favoring suppression over generalization (i.e. moving the slider to the left) and performing a 
       fixpoint-adaptive recoding process with a parameter of 0.05.</p>

    <p>ARX will perform local recoding by recursively executing a global recoding algorithm on all records that have been suppressed
       in the previous iteration. With this method, asignificant improvement in homogeneity and data utility is achieved compared
       to other local recoding algorithms.</p>
