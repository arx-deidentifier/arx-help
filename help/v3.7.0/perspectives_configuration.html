    <h4>Configuring the de-identification process</h4>
    <p>In the configuration perspective, data can be imported, generalization hierarchies can be created, and the anonymization process
       can be parameterized.</p>
    <p>The data import process supports a variety of data sources with user defined syntax, and allows the specification of attribute meta-data, 
       including data type and format.</p>
    <p>Generalization hierarchies can be created for quasi-identifier and sensitive attributes in interval, ordinal and mask form.  
       Hierarchies can be created with software assistance or imported from CSV files.</p>
    <p>The anonymization process is parameterized in the privacy and utility sub-panels.  The privacy sub-panel allows the selection
       of one or more privacy models.  For applicable privacy models, population and financial data can also be specified.  The utility
       sub-panel allows the selection of a utility measure.  For applicable utility measures, a variety of related parameters can be configured 
       (e.g. suppression, generalization, aggregation, monotonicity and precomputation).</p>
