    <h4>Re-identification risks</h4>
    <p>This view displays an overview of several measures for re-identification risks. In the upper area
       of this perspective, risk estimates are provided for three different attacker models: (1) the prosecutor scenario, (2) the
       journalist scenario and (3) the marketer scenario.</p>
    <p>Thresholds can be provided for the highest risk of any record, for the records that have a risk higher than this threshold and
       for the average fraction of records that can successfully be re-identified.
       More details about the methods can be found in the book
       <em>Guide to the anonymization of Personal Health Information</em> by Khaled el Emam.</p>

    <p>In the lower part of the perspective, selected measures of prosecutor re-identification risks are displayed. These 
       measures are based on the sample itself. They are complemented by numbers on population uniqueness from a selected
       statistical model:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lowest prosecutor re-identification risk.</li>
        <li>Individuals affected by lowest risk.</li>
        <li>Highest prosecutor re-identification risk.</li>
        <li>Individuals affected by highest risk.</li>
        <li>Average prosecutor re-identification risk.</li>
        <li>Fraction of unique records.</li>
    </ul>
