    <h4>Configuring the privacy model, transformation model and utility measures</h4>
    <p>In this section, first, a data set can be imported into the tool and attributes can be characterized.
       Second, generalization hierarchies for quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes can be generated
       semi-automatically with built-in wizards or imported into the tool. Third, privacy models, the method for
       measuring data utility and further parameters, which control the transformation process, can be
       specified.</p>
