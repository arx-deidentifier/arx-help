    <p>The figure shows the controls for filtering the displayed subset of the solution space. First, a
        quasi-identifier can be selected and the displayed transformations can be limited to the ones defining given
        generalization levels for the selected quasi identifier. Second, the displayed transformations can be limited to
        anonymous, non-anonymous or unknown transformations. The slider on the bottom allow to display only
        transformation with an information loss that is in between the defined minimum and maximum boundaries. Note that
        the information loss of transformations that have not been checked explicitly are not known to the tool and are
        therefore described by intervals defined by its successors and predecessors. These intervals might be wrong when
        an approximate anonymization is performed.</p>
