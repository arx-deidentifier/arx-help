    <h3>Gobal settings</h3>
    <p>
        The settings window is accessible from either the application menu or the application toolbar. The <em>Project</em>
        tab allows to alter general project properties. The <em>I/O settings</em> tab allows to configure basic
        properties for the import and export of data. The <em>Transformation</em> tab can be utilized to alter some
        aspects of the data transformations performed by the tool. When <em>remove outliers</em> is checked, the values
        of the quasi-identifiers are remove for tuples that are outliers. Otherwise, these values are preserved. To this
        end, they are replaced by the <em>suppression string</em>. The <em>maximum size of the search space</em> defines an
        upper bound for the number of transformations, which is defined as the produce of the heights quasi-identifiers' 
        generalization hierarchies.

        The <em>Internals</em> tab allows to adjust some parameters of the optimizations employed by ARX.
        Changing the <em>number of snapshots</em> enables users to control a space-time-tradeoff used during data anonymization.
        Choosing a value of <em>1</em> greatly reduces the main memory requirements of the tool, while leading to
        potentially significantly increased execution times. Choosing a larger value will reduce execution times, but
        increase memory consumption. The default value is <em>200</em>. The <em>Visualization</em> tab allows to control the
        visualizations of the solution space in the exploration perspective. The <em>Risk analysis</em> tab allows defining 
        parameter for risk-based anonymization. The <em>Solver</em> tab allows to specify parameters of our implementation of
        Newton'-Raphson's method used for population-based risk models. Here, you may specify options such as the total
        number of iterations, iterations per try and the required accuracy.
