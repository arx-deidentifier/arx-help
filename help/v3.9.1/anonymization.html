    <h4>Performing the anonymization</h4>
    <p>ARX provides a dedicated dialog for selecting an adequate search strategy, configuring aspects of the
    transformation model, and, finally, starting the anonymization process:</p>
    <img src="img/ch1-anonymization/p0104_01_anonymization.png" alt="Anonymization" width="511" height="371" /> 
    <p>Two different types of search strategies are supported:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Optimal search strategy.</li>
		<li>Heuristic search strategy.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The optimal search strategy reliably determines the transformation resulting in the highest
	possible quality of output data but scalability issues may occur when processing large datasets. The heuristic
	search strategies will terminate after a pre-defined number of search steps or a pre-defined amount of time.
	They are often able to determine the optimal strategy, but optimality can not be guaranteed in the general case.
	For large datasets they work on a best-effort basis.</p>
	<p>Four different heuristic search strategies are supported:</p>
	    <ol>
		<li>Top-down specialization.</li>
		<li>Bottom-up generalization.</li>
		<li>Binary search, which combines top-down and bottom-up.</li>
		<li>Genetic search.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Two different transformation models are supported:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Global transformation: the same transformation strategy will be applied to all records in the dataset.</li>
        <li>Local transformation: different transformation strategies can be applied to different subset of the records
        in the dataset. A limit on the number of different transformations that may be used can be specified.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By combining the different transformation models with different transformation rules for the individual attributes a
    wide variety of transformation methods can be used in combination:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <em>global transformation</em> can be used to implement (1) full-domain generalization, (2) top- and bottom-coding
        (there is a shortcut for creating according rules in the hierarchy editor), (3) attribute-suppression
        (there is a shortcut for creating according rules in the hierarchy editor), (4) record-suppression and (5) micro-aggregation.</li>
        <li>The <em>local transformation</em> can be used to implement (1) full-domain generalization
        (by defining a fixed generalization level), (2) top- and bottom-coding (by defining a fixed generalization level),
        (3) local generalization, (4) attribute-suppression (by defining a fixed generalization level), (5) cell-suppression
        and (6) micro-aggregation.</li>
        <li>In addition, random sampling can be performed in the respective view in the configuration perspective.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While it is not generally true that global transformation will involve less computational costs than local transformation, the 
    former is typically faster. In each iteration of the local transformation method the selected search strategy will be used. Note,
    however, that using the optimal strategy in each iteration does not necessarily imply that overall solution computed through 
    local transformation will also be optimal.</p>
