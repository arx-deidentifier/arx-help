    <h4>Comparing input and output data</h4>
    <p>In this section a transformed data set can be compared to the original input data set. 
       Both tables are synchronized when they are browsed using the horizontal or vertical scroll bars.</p>
    <p>The check boxes indicate, which rows are part of the research sample. The check boxes in the table displaying the
        output data set, indicate the sample that was selected when the de-identification process was performed. They cannot be
        altered. The check boxes in the table displaying the input data set represent the current research sample. They are editable.</p>

    <p>Each table offers a few options, that are accessible via buttons in the top-right corner of the view:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pressing the first button will sort the data according to the currently selected attribute.</li>
        <li>Pressing the second button will sort the output data set according to all quasi-identifiers and then highlight
            the equivalence classes.</li>
        <li>Pressing the third button will toggle whether all records of the data set are displayed or only the current research sample.</li>
    </ol>
