    <h4>Population uniqueness</h4>
 	<p>ARX supports the estimation of marketer re-identification risks based on the number of population uniques in a sample.
 	   Population uniques are records that are unique within the sample (sample uniques) that are also unique within the
 	   overall population. Note: Not all sample uniques are also population uniques. When no data about the population has been 
 	   loaded into ARX, this number can be estimated with statistical models. Super-population models 
 	   estimate the characteristics of the overall population with probability
       distributions that are parameterized with sample characteristics. ARX supports 
       the methods by Hoshino (Pitman), Zayatz and Chen and McNulty (SNB).</p>
    <p>Different models may return differently accurate estimates of the number of population uniques. As a rule of thumb,
       the Pitman model should be used for sampling fractions lower than or equal to 10%. ARX also implements a
       decision rule proposed and validated for clinical data sets by Dankar et al. More information can be found here 
       (<em>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/12/66</em>).</p>
    <p>The tool also provides a perspective for comparing the results of different methods under the assumption of different
       sampling fractions:</p>

    <p>This view displays the estimates by the method of Dankar et al., again, for different sampling
       fractions:</p>

    <p>In the process of computing estimates with statistical models ARX must solve non-linear bivariate equation systems.
       The solver used by ARX can be configured in the settings dialog. Here, you may specify options such as the total
       number of iterations, iterations per try and the required accuracy etc. Changing these settings may influence the 
       precision of the results and the time required to obtain time.</p>
    <p>Note: Methods for estimating population uniqueness assume that the dataset is a uniform sample of the population.
        If this is not the case, results may be inaccurate.</p>
