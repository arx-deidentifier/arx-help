    <p>This section shows a heat map or a table visualizing the contingency of two selected attributes.</p>

    <p>Note: ARX tries to present comparable data visualizations of properties of the original and transformed data sets. For this purpose, it
       uses information from the attributes' data types and relationships between values extracted from the
       generalization hierarchies. As a consequence, specifying reasonable data types and hierarchies will increase the quality
       and comparability of data visualizations.</p>
