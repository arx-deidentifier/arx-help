    <h4>Population uniqueness</h4>
 	<p>ARX supports the estimation of re-identification risks based on the number of population uniquenes in a sample.
 	   This number can be estimated with statistical models. Super-population models 
 	   estimate the characteristics of the overall population with probability
       distributions that are parameterized with sample characteristics. ARX supports 
       the methods by Hoshino (Pitman), Zayatz and Chen and McNulty (SNB).</p>
    <p>Different models may return differently accurate estimates of the number of population uniques. As a rule of thumb,
       the Pitman model should be used for sampling fractions lower than or equal to 10%. ARX also implements a
       decision rule proposed and validated for clinical data sets by Dankar et al. More information can be found here 
       (<em>http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/12/66</em>).</p>
    <p>The tool also provides a perspective for comparing the results of different methods under the assumption of different
       sampling fractions:</p>

    <p>This view displays the resulting estimates by the method of Dankar et al., again, for different sampling
       fractions:</p>

    <p>For computing estimates from super-population models ARX must solve non-linear bivariate equation systems.
       The solver used by ARX can be con screen shotd in the settings dialog. Here, you may specify options such as the total
       number of iterations, iterations per try and the required accuracy etc. This may influence the precision of results
       and execution times.</p>
