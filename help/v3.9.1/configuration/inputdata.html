    <h4>3.1. Tables representing input and output data</h4>
    <p>ARX displays input and output data in special tables with headers which indicate attribute types by different colors:</p>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Red indicates an <em>identifying attribute</em>.</li>
            <li>Yellow indicates a <em>quasi-identifying attribute</em>.</li>
            <li>Purple indicates a <em>sensitive attribute</em>.</li>
            <li>Green indicates an <em>insensitive attribute</em>.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>Each record is further associated with a checkbox. These checkboxes indicate, which records are contained in the specified
       research sample. The checkboxes in the view for output datasets, indicate the sample that was specified when the 
       anonymization process was last executed. They cannot be edited. The checkboxes in the view for the input dataset 
       represent the current research sample. They are editable.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.9.1/img/configuration/sort_buttons.png" alt="Data options" width="104" height="28" />
    <p>Each table offers a few options that are accessible via buttons in the top-right corner:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first button sorts the data according to the currently selected column.</li>
        <li>The second button sorts the output dataset according to all quasi-identifiers and then highlights equivalence classes.</li>
        <li>The third button controls whether all records are shown or only records contained in the research sample.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
