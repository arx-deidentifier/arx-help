    <h4>Classification accuracy</h4>
    <p>This section can be used to compare the performance of classification models trained on anonymized output data. 
    Please note that ARX supports a specific quality model for optimizing output data towards suitability as a training set for model generation.</p>
    <p>In the view displayed at the bottom left, the features and target variables can be selected and feature scaling functions may be specified:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/utility/analyze_9.png" alt="Classification accuracy" width="580" height="136" />
    <p>In the view displayed at the bottom right, different types of classification models can be selected and configured:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/utility/analyze_18.png" alt="Classification accuracy" width="580" height="139" />
    <p>ARX currently (3.7.0) supports the following types of classification models:</p>
       <ol>
    	<li>Logistic regression.</li>
        <li>Random forest.</li>
        <li>Naive Bayes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The section displayed at the top shows the results of the performance analysis. For input as well as output data, it displays
    the number of instances of the class attribute as well as various performance parameters. Performance measures are typically
    expressed relative to the performance of a trivial ZeroR classifier trained on unmodified input data and the selected type of model 
    also trained on input data. Results are obtained using k-fold cross-validation.</p>
    <p>The section "overview", displays relative classification accuracy as well as sensitivity, specificity and Brier score:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/utility/analyze_19.png" alt="Classification accuracy" width="580" height="160" />
    <p>The section "ROC Curves", displays ROC curves and the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for selected instances of the class attribute:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/utility/analyze_20.png" alt="Classification accuracy" width="580" height="258" />
    <p>Please note that ARX uses an one-vs-all approach to calculate performance measures for multinomial classifiers.</p>
