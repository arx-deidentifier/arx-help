    <h3>Attributes and generalization hierarchies</h3>
    <p>This area allows to assign attribute and data types to columns and to specify the generalization that can be
        applied to quasi-identifying attributes and be used to compute distances between sensitive attributes. As shown
        in area 1, each tab is associated to one column in the input dataset. The dropdown list shown in area 2 allows
        to specify the according attribute type for the column, whereas the dropdown list in area 3 allows to specify a
        data type. Specifying a data type is optional but yields better results when creating generalization hierarchies
        via ARX's built-in wizard and when visualizing data properties in the analysis perspective. Some data types are
        associated with a format string, which can be specified in area 4.</p>

    <p>Area 5 displays a tabular representation of the associated generalization hierarchy, if there is any. The
        values from the original input dataset are shown in the first column and the level of generalization increases
        from left to right. This area also implements a basic editor for generalization hierarchies, which allows to
        move, add and delete columns or rows and to alter the values of the cells. Please note that the defined
        generalization hierarchy must be monotonic (meaning that it must resemble a tree structure), otherwise the tool
        will abort with an error message when anonymizing data. As a starting point for defining generalization
        hierarchies, the tool offers a wizard, which is able to create generalization hierarchies for many common types
        of attributes. The wizard can be launched via the application menu or via an associated button in the
        application’s toolbar. The drop-down lists in area 6 allow specifying minimal and maximal generalization levels
        that should be applied for the selected attribute.</p>
