    <h4>Finding quasi-identifiers</h4>
    <p>In this section, combinations of attributes can be analyzed for associated risks of re-identification.
       The view provides information about the degree to which combinations of variables separate the records from each other
       and to which degree the variables make records distinct.
       First, you must select a set of attributes to analyze in the bottom left area.</p>

    <p>ARX will then calculate the aforementioned parameters.
       You may use this information to decide which quasi-identifiers need to be protected.</p>
