    <h4>Analysis of data utility</h4>
    <p>To assess the suitability of a specific transformation for a given usage scenario, this perspective supports
       comparing transformations of the input dataset to the original data. To this end, it incorporates various
       graphical representations of results of univariate and bivariate statistics and cell-by-cell comparisons.</p>

    <p>The perspective also allows to analyze the classification accuracy that can be achieved with a generic logistic regression method.</p>
    <p>Finally, the perspective also implements a method for local recoding that can be used to further enhance data utility.</p>
