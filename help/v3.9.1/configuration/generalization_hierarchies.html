    <h4>Creating generalization hierarchies</h4>
    <p>ARX offers different methods for creating generalization hierarchies for different types of attributes.
        Generalization hierarchies created with the wizard are stored as functions, meaning that they can
        be created for the entire domain of an attribute without explicitly addressing the specific values in a concrete
        dataset. This enables the handling of continuous variables. Moreover, hierarchy specifications can be imported and
        exported and they can thus be reused for anonymizing different datasets with similar attributes. It is important
        that adequate data types are specified prior to using the wizard. The wizard can be used to create four different
        types of hierarchies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Masking-based hierarchies: this general-purpose mechanism allows creating hierarchies for a broad
            spectrum of attributes.</li>
        <li>Interval-based hierarchies: these hierarchies can be used for variables with a ratio scale.</li>
        <li>Order-based hierarchies: this method can be used for variables with an ordinal scale.</li>
        <li>Date-based hierarchies: this method can be used for dates.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Masking-based hierarchies</h5>
    <p>Masking is a flexible mechanism that can be applied to many types of attributes and which is especially suitable
        for alphanumeric codes, such as ZIP codes. The following image shows a screenshot of the
        respective wizard:</p>
    <img src="../img/ch3-configuration/p0303_01_redaction_wizard.png" alt="Masking-based wizard" width="408" height="278" /> 
    <p>In the wizard, masking follows a two-step process. First, values are aligned either to the left or to the right.
        Then the characters are masked, again, either from left to right, or from right to left. All values are
        adjusted to a common length by adding padding characters. This character, as well as the character used
        for masking can be specified by the user.</p>
    <h5>Interval-based hierarchies</h5>
    <p>Intervals are a natural means of generalization for values with a ratio scale, such as integers or decimals.
        ARX offers a graphical editor for efficiently defining sets of intervals over the complete
        range of variables having any of the above data types. First a sequence of intervals can be
        defined on the left side of the view. In the next step, subsequent levels consisting of groups of intervals from
        the previous level can be specified. Each group combines a given number of elements from the previous level. Any sequence of intervals or
        groups is automatically repeated to cover the complete range of the attribute. For example, to generalize
        arbitrary integers into intervals of length 10, only one interval [0, 10] needs to be defined. Defining a group
        of size two on the next level, automatically generalizes integers into groups of size 20. As is shown in the
        image (W1), the editor visually indicates automatically created repetitions of intervals and groups.</p>
    <img src="../img/ch3-configuration/p0303_02_interval_wizard_1.png" alt="Interval editor" width="408" height="278" /> 
    <p>To be able to create labels for intervals, each element must be associated with an aggregate function (W2).
       The following aggregate functions are supported:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set: a set-representation of input values is returned.</li>
        <li>Prefix: a set of prefixes of the input values is returned. A parameter allows defining the length of these prefixes.</li>
        <li>Common-prefix: returns the largest common prefix.</li>
        <li>Bounds: returns the first and last elements of the set.</li>
        <li>Interval: an interval between the minimal and maximal value is returned.</li>
        <li>Constant: returns a predefined-constant value.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Clicking on an interval or a group prompts an editor which can be used for specifying parameters. Elements can
        be removed, added and merged by right-clicking their graphical representation. Intervals are defined by a
        minimum (inclusive) and maximum (exclusive) bound. Groups are defined by their size:</p>
    <img src="../img/ch3-configuration/p0303_03_interval_wizard_4.png" alt="Group" width="408" height="278" /> 
    <p>Interval-based hierarchies might define ranges in which they are to be applied. Any value out of the range 
    defined by "minimum value" or "maximum value" will produce an error message. This can be used to implement sanity checks.
     Any value between the minimal or maximal value and the "bottom coding" or "top coding" values will be top- or bottom-coded.
     If values fall into an interval stretching from the bottom coding or top coding limit to the "snap" limit, it
     will be extended to the bottom or top coding limit.  Within the remaining range intervals will be repeated..</p>

    <h5>Order-based hierarchies</h5>
    <p>Order-based hierarchies follow a similar principle as interval-based hierarchies, but they can be applied to
        attributes with ordinal scale. In addition to the types of attributes covered by interval-based hierarchies this
        includes strings, using their lexicographical order, and ordinals. First, attributes within the
        domain are ordered as defined by the user or the data type. Second, ordered values can be
        grouped using a mechanism similar to the one used for interval-based hierarchies. Note that order-based hierarchies are
        especially useful for ordinal strings and therefore display the complete domain of an attribute instead of only
        the values contained in the concrete dataset. The mechanism can be used to create semantic hierarchies from a
        pre-defined meaningful ordering of the domain of a discrete variable. Subsequent generalizations of values from
        the domain can be labeled with user defined constants.</p>

        <h5>Date-based hierarchies</h5>
    <p>This wizard supports the creation of hierarchies for dates by specifying the granularity of output data at increasing
       generalization levels. Please note that it is important to specify granularity levels that form an hierarchy (e.g.
       day-of-week can typically not be followed by week-of-year, because the same day-of-week can be generalized
       to different weeks of a year). When this constraint is violated, ARX will raise an error message during the
       anonymization process.</p>
    <img src="../img/ch3-configuration/p0303_06_date_wizard.png" alt="Date-based wizard" width="408" height="280" /> 
    <p>In a final step, all wizards show a tabular representation of the resulting hierarchy for the current input dataset. 
        Additionally, the number of groups on each level is calculated. The functional representation created in the process can be
        exported and reused for different datasets with similar attributes.</p>
