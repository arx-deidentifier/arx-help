    <h4>Configuration perspective</h4>
    <p>In the configuration perspective, data can be imported, transformation rules can be created, and privacy as well as quality models
    can be selected and parameterized. Input data is always displayed on the left hand side.</p>

    <p>The data import wizard supports a variety of data sources and allows to specify meta data, such as data types and formats.
    ARX is able to import data from CSV files, MS Excel spreadsheets and relational database systems, such as MS SQL, DB2, MySQL or PostgreSQL.</p>

    <p>The data import wizard also supports the renaming, removing and reordering of columns.
    During data import, data types are automatically detected and data cleansing may be performed. This means that values that do not conform to the 
    specified data type will be replaced with specific null values, which are handled correctly by all methods implemented in ARX.</p>
    <p>All tabular data displayed by ARX can be exported into CSV files via context menus.
    ARX uses value generalization hierarchies to implement a wide variety of data transformation methods. These hierarchies
    can either be created within the software (via specific wizards) or imported from CSV files. Hierarchies created with ARX
    can also be exported to CSV files.</p>
