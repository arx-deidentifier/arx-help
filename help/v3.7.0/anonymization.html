    <h4>Performing the anonymization</h4>
    <p>ARX provides a dedicated dialog for selecting an adequate search strategy, configuring aspects of the
    transformation model, and, finally, starting the anonymization process:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/anonymization.png" alt="Anonymization" width="535" height="333" />
    <p>Three different search strategies are available:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Optimal search strategy.</li>
		<li>Heuristic search strategy terminating after a pre-defined number of search steps.</li>
		<li>Heuristic search strategy terminating after a pre-defined amount of time.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Please note that the optimal search strategy reliably determines the transformation resulting in the highest
	possible quality of output data but scalability issues may occur when processing large datasets. The heuristic
	search strategies are often able to determine the optimal strategy very quickly, but optimality can not be guaranteed.
	For large datasets they work on a best-effort basis.
	<p>Two different transformation models are supported:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Global transformation: the same transformation strategy will be applied to all records in the dataset.</li>
        <li>Local transformation: different transformation strategies can be applied to different subset of the records
        in the dataset. A limit on the number of different transformations that may be used can be specified.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By combining the different transformation models with different transformation rules for the individual attributes a
    wide variety of transformation methods can be used in combination:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <em>global transformation</em> can be used to implement (1) full-domain generalization, (2) top- and bottom-coding
        (there is a shortcut for creating according rules in the hierarchy editor), (3) attribute-suppression
        (there is a shortcut for creating according rules in the hierarchy editor), (4) record-suppression and (5) micro-aggregation.</li>
        <li>The <em>local transformation</em> can be used to implement (1) full-domain generalization
        (by defining a fixed generalization level), (2) top- and bottom-coding (by defining a fixed generalization level),
        (3) local generalization, (4) attribute-suppression (by defining a fixed generalization level), (5) cell-suppression
        and (6) micro-aggregation.</li>
        <li>In addition, random sampling can be performed in the respective view in the configuration perspective.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While it is not generally true that global transformation will involve less computational costs than local transformation, the 
    former is typically faster. In each iteration of the local transformation method the selected search strategy will be used. Note,
    however, that using the optimal strategy in each iteration does not necessarily imply that overall solution computed through 
    local transformation will also be optimal.</p>
