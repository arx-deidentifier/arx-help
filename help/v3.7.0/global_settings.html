    <h4>Project settings</h4>
    <p>The settings window is accessible from either the application menu or the application toolbar.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.6.0/img/general_settings_1.png" alt="Project settings" width="570" height="468" />
    <p>The <em>Project</em> section is used to alter general project properties -
        <ul>
            <li>Project metadata, including name, description and localization, can be updated.</li>
            <li>The default syntax for file I/O can be specified.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Internals</em> section is used to adjust performance and visualization parameters -
        <ul>
            <li>Snapshot settings control the space-time trade-off during de-identification.  Larger snapshot values will 
            typically reduce execution time but increase memory consumption.</li>
            <li>To speed up de-identification for larger datasets, utility analyses can be disabled.</li> 
        </ul>
    </p> 
    <p>The <em>Transformation</em> section provides options for altering and simplifying the presentation of transformed data -
        <ul>
            <li>Outliers can be removed from non-anonymous transformations, leaving only de-identified records in the output.</li>    
            <li>Sensitive and insensitive attributes can be masked in suppressed tuples.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Search method</em> section is used to configure search strategy and risk based anonymization -
        <ul>
            <li>Time limited heuristic search can be enabled by default or for large search spaces.</li>
            <li>Suppression of records with insufficient utility can be disabled.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Utility analysis</em> section is used to refine summary statistics and utility measures -
        <ul>
            <li>Generalization hierarchies can be configured as functional or explicit, where a functional hierarchy represents the 
            entire domain of a given attribute, while an explicit hierarchy represents only values in the dataset.</li>
            <li>Logistic regression performance, used for generic classification and calculation of precision and recall, can be
            fine tuned through a variety or parameters.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Risk analysis</em> section provides configuration options for the Newton-Raphson method used to solve the system
       of bivariate non-linear equations evaluated for population-based risk models -</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimization parameter include the total number of iterations, iterations per try and the required accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
