    <h4>Properties of output data</h4>
    <p>This view displays basic properties about the selected data transformation as well as the resulting output dataset. 
       These properties include the score calculated using the specified utility measure and further settings (e.g. attribute weights), the 
       number of suppressed records, the number of equivalence classes and the number of classes containing suppressed records.
       If the transformation is privacy-preserving, a complete specification of all privacy models is provided.</p>

    <p>Note: The information provided in this view is based on the specification which has been defined in the configuration 
       perspective prior to performing the anonymization process. The state of the workbench will remain unchanged, even if these definitions are 
       changed. To bring changes into effect, the data anonymization process needs to be executed again.</p>
