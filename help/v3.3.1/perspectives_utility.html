    <h4>Analysis of data utility</h4>
    <p>To assess the suitability of a specific transformation for a given usage scenario, this perspective supports
       comparing transformations of the input data set to the original data. To this end, it incorporates various
       graphical representations of results of univariate and bivariate statistics and supports cell-by-cell comparisons.</p>

    <p>To evaluate the suitability of the resulting data set for machine learning purposes, the perspective also allows 
       to analyze the classification accuracy that can be achieved with a generic logistic regression method.</p>
    <p>Finally, the perspective also implements a method for local recoding that can be used to further enhance data utility.</p>
