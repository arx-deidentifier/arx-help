    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this perspective, firstly, a data set can be imported into the tool and attributes can be characterized.
        Secondly, generalization hierarchies for quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes can be generated
        automatically with wizards or imported into the tool. Thirdly, the privacy model, the transformation model and the
        utility measure can be specified and configured.</p>

    <p>The perspective is divided into five main areas. Area 1 shows the current input data set, area 2 supports
        specifying information about its attributes, area 3 supports configuring the privacy model, area 4 supports configuring
        further properties of the transformation process, such as the coding model, how data utility should be
        measured and how important certain attributes are. Area 5 allows defining a research data set, which is a subset
        of the overall data set that is to be anonymized and exported.</p>
