    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this perspective the re-identification risks of an input or output data set can be analyzed with several
        sample-based or population-based models. Area 1 shows data about the equivalence classes of the original
        data set, whereas area 2 shows the same data about the transformed data set. Area 3 and 4 display
        risk estimates derived from the original and transformed data set respectively.</p>
