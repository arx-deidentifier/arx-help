    <h4>Specifying attribute properties</h4>
    <p>Attribute properties can be set in the tabs "data transformation" and "attribute metadata" within this perspective.
    To set an attribute's properties, it must first be selected in the tabular view of the dataset.
    The views in the tabs will be linked with the selected attribute and updated accordingly.</p>

    <h4>Data transformation</h4>
    <p>The transformation tab can be used to set the type of an attribute and the associated transformation method.
    The transformation tab also displays the attribute's generalization hierarchy and provides a context menu for in-place editing.</p>

    <p>Supported attribute types:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Identifying attributes</em> will be removed from the dataset.</li>
        <li><em>Quasi-identifying attributes</em> will be transformed.</li>
        <li><em>Sensitive attributes</em> will be kept as-is but they can be protected using privacy models, such as t-closeness or l-diversity.</li>
        <li><em>Insensitive attributes</em> will be kept unmodified.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: the specified type of an attribute is also indicated by a color coded bullet, next to the attribute name, in the input tab.</p>
    <p>Note: since version 3.7.0 there are also specific buttons that can be used to assign a certain attribute type to all attributes in the dataset.</p>

    <p>Supported transformation methods include generalization, microaggregation and suppression. When generalization is selected, minimum and maximum generalization levels can
    be specified. Microaggregation may be performed with or without prior clustering using the specified value generalization hierarchies, Moreover,
    the aggregation function and how missing values should be handled can be specified.</p>
    <p>The associated value generalization hierarchy is displayed in tabular form. Original attribute values
    are displayed in the leftmost column, with generalization levels increasing from left to right.  Right clicking the table brings up a context menu providing access to editing
    functionalities. This can be used to create simple hierarchies or to simple modifications to existing hierarchies. Moreover, hierarchies representing attribute suppression
    can be created. For creating more complex hierarchies, ARX supports several <em>wizards,</em> 
    which can be launched from the application menu and the tool bar.</p>
    <h4>Attribute metadata</h4>
    <p>This view can be used to specify data types (including formats) of attributes. Please note that the correct data type is needed to use most of
    the wizards for hierarchy creation.</p>
    <img src="../img/ch3-configuration/p0302_04_metadata.png" alt="Metadata" width="566" height="388" /> 
    <p>Supported data types:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>String: a generic sequence of characters. This is the default data type.</li>
        <li>Integer: a data type for numbers without a fractional component.</li>
        <li>Decimal: a data type for numbers with fractional component.</li>
        <li>Date/time: a data type for dates (with or without time).</li>
        <li>Ordinal: string variables with an ordinal scale.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Data types can be set by right clicking on an attribute's row in the table. When needed, ARX will ask for a suitable format string.
    Specifying a data type is optional but yields better results when creating generalization hierarchies and 
    visualizing data in the analysis perspective.</p>
    <p>Variables can be defined as "response variables" in modeling efforts that will be performed using output data.
    When combined with an appropriate data quality model, ARX will then try to minimize impacts on the structural relationships between
    quasi-identifying variables and the specified response variables.</p>
