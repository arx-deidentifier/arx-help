    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this perspective, firstly, a dataset can be imported into the tool and attributes can be characterized.
        Secondly, generalization hierarchies for quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes can be generated
        automatically by means of a wizard or imported into the tool. Thirdly, the desired privacy criterion and the
        metric for information loss can be specified.</p>

    <p>This perspective is divided into five main areas. Area 1 shows the current input dataset, area 2 allows to
        specify information about its attributes, area 3 is for defining privacy criteria, area 4 enables specifying
        further properties of the transformation process, such as the coding model, how loss in utility should be
        measured and how important certain attributes are. Area 5 allows defining a research dataset, which is a subset
        of the overall dataset that is to be anonymized and exported.</p>
