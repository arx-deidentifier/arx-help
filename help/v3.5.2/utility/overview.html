    <h4>Analyzing data utility</h4>
    <p>When a solution candidate has been selected, this perspective can be used to evaluate its utility for the anticipated usage
       scenario. For this purpose, it is possible to compare the transformed data set to the original input data set. 
       In the center, this perspective will display the original data (area 1) and the result of the selected transformation (area 2). 
       Both tables are synchronized when they are browsed using the horizontal or vertical scroll bars. The areas 3 and 4 allow to 
       compare statistical information about the currently selected attribute(s).</p>

    <p>The view further displays results of univariate and bivariate statistics and basic properties about the input and output data set.
       Moreover, it provides access to statistics about the distribution of equivalence classes and the suppressed records. Finally,
       classification accuracy can be analyzed with a generic logistic regression method.</p>
    <p>Note: ARX tries to present comparable data visualizations for original and transformed data sets. For this purpose, it
       uses information from the attributes' data types and relationships between values extracted from the
       generalization hierarchies. As a result, specifying reasonable data types and hierarchies will increase the quality
       and comparability of data visualizations.</p>
