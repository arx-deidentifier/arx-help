    <h3>Overview of the different perspectives</h3>
    <p>The ARX anonymization tool is divided into four perspectives, which model different aspects of the
        anonymization process. As is depicted in the Figure shown below, these steps consist of 1) configuring privacy
        criteria and transformation methods, 2) exploring the solution space and 3) analyzing data in terms of utility
        and re-identification risks. In the configuration phase, input data is loaded, transformation rules are imported
        or created and all further parameters, such as privacy criteria, are specified. When the solution space has been
        characterized by executing an anonymization algorithm, the exploration phase supports searching for
        privacy-preserving data transformations that fulfill the user’s requirements. To assess suitability, the utility
        analysis phase allows comparing transformed datasets to the original input dataset with methods of descriptive
        statistics. Finally, risk-analyses can be performed for input datasets as well as their transformed
        representations. Based on these analyses, further solution candidates might be considered and analyzed, or the
        configuration of the anonymization process can be altered.</p>

    <h4>Configuring privacy guarantees and transformation methods</h4>
    <p>
        In this section, firstly, a dataset can be imported into the tool and attributes can be characterized. Secondly,
        generalization hierarchies for quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes can be generated semi-automatically by
        means of a wizard or imported into the tool. Thirdly, privacy criteria, the method for measuring data utility
        and further parameters, such as parameters of the transformation process, can be specified. More information
        about this perspective can be found <a title="Configuration"

    <h4>Exploration of the solution space</h4>
    <p>
        As a result of the anonymization process, a solution space is constructed and characterized based on the given
        parameters. This perspective allows users to browse the space of data transformations, organize and filter it
        according to their needs and select further transformations for analysis. More information about this
        perspective can be found <a title="Exploration"
            href="http://arx.deidentifier.org/anonymization-tool/exploration/">here</a>.

    <h4>Analysis of transformed data</h4>
    <p>
        To assess the suitability of a specific transformation for a given usage scenario, this perspective enables
        comparing transformations of the input dataset to the original data. To this end, it incorporates various
        graphical representations of results of statistical analyses and also allows for a cell-by-cell comparison. More
        information about this perspective can be found <a title="Utility analysis"
            href="http://arx.deidentifier.org/anonymization-tool/analysis/">here</a>.

    <h4>Analysis of re-identification risks</h4>
    <p>
        In this perspective, the distribution of class sizes, the risks associated to individual quasi-identifiers, as
        well as sample-based and population-based risk estimates can be analyzed. The view displays details about the
        results of estimating uniqueness with different super-population models. More information about this perspective
        can be found <a title="Risk analysis" href="http://arx.deidentifier.org/anonymization-tool/risk-analysis/">here</a>.

    <h4>Import and export of data</h4>
    <p>Generalization hierarchies and datasets can be exported as and imported from files containing character
        separated values, which allows to exchange data with common tools such as spreadsheet programs. For loading data
        into ARX, further data sources are supported. This includes MS Excel spreadsheets and data from relational
        database systems, such as MS SQL, DB2, MySQL or PostgreSQL. Data import is performed using a dedicated wizard,
        which is shown in the following image.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.0.0/img/import_data.png" alt="Import" width="308" height="265" />
    <p>In addition to access to different types of data sources, this wizard allows renaming and hiding columns, as
        well as changing their order. Data types are automatically detected and data cleansing may be performed. This
        means that values that do not conform to the selected data type will be replaced with null values. Missing
        values are handled correctly by all methods provided in the ARX tool.</p>
