    <h4>Finding quasi-identifiers</h4>
    <p>In this section, combinations of attributes can be analyzed for associated risks of re-identification.
       This analysis uses estimates of uniqueness either based on the sample or on a super-population model. You may
       specify this in the settings dialog. First, you must select a set of attributes to analyze in the bottom left area.</p>

    <p>ARX will then determine the average risk of re-identification that is associated with the power set of the
       selected set of attributes. You may use this information to decide which quasi-identifiers need to be protected
       in your data set.</p>
