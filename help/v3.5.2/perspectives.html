    <h4>Overview of ARX's perspectives</h4>
    <p>The ARX anonymization tool is divided into four perspectives, which model different aspects of the
       de-identification process. As is shown in the below  screen shot, these steps consist of 1) configuring privacy
       models, utility measures and transformation methods, 2) exploring the solution space, 3) analyzing data utility and
       4) analyzing privacy risks.</p>

    <p>In the configuration perspective, input data can be loaded, transformation rules can be specified
       and all further parameters, such as privacy models and utility measures, can be selected and parameterized. 
       If required, this step can be prepared by performing a risk analysis. Next, the solution space is
       characterized by executing a de-identification algorithm. The result can be inspected in the exploration perspective.
       Here, it is possible to search for privacy-preserving data transformations which fulfill the user's requirements, i.e.
       for transformations that result in output data that is suited for the intended usage scenario. To assess this suitability, 
       the utility analysis perspective provides methods for comparing transformed data sets to the original input data set with 
       methods of descriptive statistics and machine learning. In the fourth perspective, risk analyses can be performed for input 
       data set as well as transformed output data. Based on the results of these analyses, the suitability of a solution candidate 
       may either be confirmed or the configuration of the de-identification process can be modified.</p>
