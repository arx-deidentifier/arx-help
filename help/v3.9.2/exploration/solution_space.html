    <h4>Visualization of the solution space</h4>
    <p>In the center of the screen, the view displays a subset of the current solution space. The solution space is visualized in
       different ways. First, it can be displayed as a Hasse diagram of the underlying generalization lattice.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.9.2/img/exploration/explore_view_lattice.png" alt="Lattice view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>Here, each node represents a single transformation, which is identified by the generalization levels that it specifies for
       the quasi-identifiers in the input dataset. Transformations are characterized by three different background
       colors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Green denotes a transformation that results in a privacy-preserving dataset.</li>
        <li>Red denotes a transformation that does not result in an privacy-preserving dataset.</li>
        <li>Orange denotes the transformation that is optimal regarding to the specified utility measure.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Transformations which have not been pruned during the anonymization process are marked with a thick blue border. Dragging the
       mouse while holding the left button can be used to navigate the visualization. Dragging the
       mouse while holding the right button can be used to zoom in and out of the current view. Hovering the mouse over a
       transformation will display a tool tip with basic information about the transformation. Clicking a transformation
       with the left button will select it, while clicking a transformation with the right button will prompt a context
       menu. Here, transformations can either be applied to the current input dataset or added to the clipboard.</p>
    <p>The solution space may also be visualized as a list:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.9.2/img/exploration/explore_view_list.png" alt="List view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>Here, each transformation is represented by one row. Transformations are sorted by score. Utility estimates and
       the anonymity property are highlighted visually.</p>
    <p>Finally, the solution space can also be visualized as a set of tiles:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.9.2/img/exploration/explore_view_tiles.png" alt="Tiles view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>This view is very similar to the list described in the previous paragraph. The color and border of an element
       encode information about the anonymity property, while the background color represents data utility. Transformations
       are also ordered by their score.</p>
