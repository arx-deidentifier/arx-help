    <h4>Defining a research sample</h4>
    <p>In this view, a research sample can be specified. It represents a sample of the underlying population that will be
        de-identified and exported. The population can be approximated by loading further data into ARX. This information
        can be used for the &delta;-presence and k-map privacy models as well as for analyses of re-identification risks.
        The buttons in the top-right corner implement different options for extracting a sample from the data set:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Selecting no data records.</li>
        <li>Selecting all data records.</li>
        <li>Selecting some records, by matching the current population data against an external sample.</li>
        <li>Selecting some records by querying the data set.</li>
        <li>Selecting some records with random sampling.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The view will show the size of the current sample and the method with which it was created. At any
       time, the research sample can be altered by clicking the checkboxes shown in the data tables. The query syntax
       is as follows: fields and constants must be enclosed in single quotes. In the example 'age' is a field and '50'
       is a constant. The following operators are supported: &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, =, or, and, ( and ). The dialog
       dynamically shows the number of rows matching the query and displays error messages in case of syntactic errors.
