    <h4>Creating generalization hierarchies</h4>
    <p>ARX offers different methods for creating generalization hierarchies for different types of attributes.
        Generalization hierarchies created with the wizard are represented in a functional manner, meaning that they can
        be created for the entire domain of an attribute without explicitly addressing the specific values in a concrete
        data set. This enables the handling of continuous variables. Moreover, hierarchy specifications can be imported and
        exported and they can thus be reused for de-identifying different data sets with similar attributes. Please make sure that you
        first select an appropriate data type for the attribute. The wizard supports three different types of
        hierarchies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Masking-based hierarchies: this general-purpose mechanism allows creating hierarchies for a broad
            spectrum of attributes.</li>
        <li>Interval-based hierarchies: these hierarchies can be applied to variables with a ratio scale.</li>
        <li>Order-based hierarchies: this method an be used for variables with an ordinal scale.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Masking-based hierarchies</h5>
    <p>Masking is a highly flexible mechanism that can be applied to many attributes and is especially suitable
        for alphanumeric codes, such as ZIP codes or telephone numbers. The following image shows a screenshot of the
        respective wizard:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/configuration/redaction_wizard.png" alt="Masking-based wizard" width="408" height="278" />
    <p>In ARX, masking follows a two-step process. First, values are aligned either to the left or to the right.
        Then the characters are masked, again, either from left to right, or from right to left. All values are
        adjusted to a common length, by introducing padding characters. This character, as well as the character used
        for masking can be specified by the user.</p>
    <h5>Interval-based hierarchies</h5>
    <p>Intervals are a natural means of generalization for values with a ratio scale, such as integers, decimals or
        dates/time stamps. ARX offers a graphical editor for efficiently defining sets of intervals over the complete
        range of any of the above data types. As is shown in the following  screen shot, first a sequence of intervals can be
        defined (shown on the left side of the  screen shot). In the next step, subsequent levels consisting of groups can be
        defined. Each group combines a given number of elements from the previous level. Any sequence of intervals or
        groups is automatically repeated to cover the complete range of the attribute. For example, to generalize
        arbitrary integers into intervals of length 10, only one interval [0, 10] needs to be defined. Defining a group
        of size two on the next level, automatically generalizes integers into groups of size 20. As is shown in the
        image (W1), the editor visually indicates automatically created repetitions of intervals and groups.</p>

    <p>For creating transformation rules, each element is associated with an aggregate function (W2). These
        functions implement means for creating labels for intervals, groups and values that are to be translated into a
        common generalized value. In case of intervals, these functions are applied to the boundaries of each
        interval. Currently, the following aggregate functions are supported:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set: a set-representation of input values is returned.</li>
        <li>Prefix: a set of prefixes of the input values is returned. A parameter allows defining the length of these prefixes.</li>
        <li>Common-prefix: returns the largest common prefix.</li>
        <li>Bounds: returns the first and last elements of the set.</li>
        <li>Interval: an interval between the minimal and maximal value is returned.</li>
        <li>Constant: returns a predefined-constant value.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Clicking, on an interval or a group selects an editor that allows altering its further parameters. Elements can
        be removed, added and merged by right-clicking their graphical representation. Intervals are defined by a
        minimum (inclusive) and maximum (exclusive) boundary. Groups are defined by their size, as is shown in the
        following  screen shot:</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/configuration/interval_wizard_4.png" alt="Group" width="408" height="278" />
    <p>Interval-based hierarchies might define ranges in which they are to be applied. Any value out of the "label"
        range, will produce an error message. This can be used for sanity checks. Any value within the "snap" range,
        will be added to the first/last interval within the "repeat" range. Within this range, the sequences of
        intervals are groups will be repeated. The first and last intervals within the "repeat" range will be adjusted
        to cover the "snap" range.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/configuration/interval_wizard_2.png" alt="Range" width="408" height="278" />
    <h5>Order-based hierarchies</h5>
    <p>Order-based hierarchies follow a similar principle as interval-based hierarchies, but they can be applied to
        attributes with ordinal scale only. In addition to the types of attributes covered by interval-based hierarchies this
        includes strings, using their lexicographical order, and ordered strings. First, the attributes within the
        domain are ordered in a user-defined manner, or as defined by the data type. Second, the ordered values can be
        grouped using a mechanism similar to the one used for interval-based hierarchies. Note that order-based hierarchies are
        especially useful for ordered strings and therefore display the complete domain of an attribute instead of only
        the values contained in the concrete data set. The mechanism can be used to create semantic hierarchies from a
        pre-defined meaningful ordering of the domain of a discrete variable. Subsequent generalizations of values from
        the domain can be labeled with user defined constants.</p>

        <h5>Date-based hierarchies</h5>
    <p>This wizard supports the creation of hierarchies for dates by specifying the granularity of output data at increasing
       generalization levels. Please note that it is important to specify granularity levels that form an hierarchy (e.g.
       day-of-week can typically not be followed by week-of-year, because the same day-of-week can be generalized
       to different weeks of a year). When this constraint is violated, ARX will raise an error message during the
       anonymization process.</p>

    <p>In a final step, all wizards show a tabular representation of the resulting hierarchy for the current input data set. 
        Additionally, the number of groups on each level is computed. The abstract specification created in the process can be
        exported and imported to allow reuse for different data sets with similar attributes.</p>
