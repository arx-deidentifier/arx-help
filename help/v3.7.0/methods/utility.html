    <h4>Supported quality/utility models</h4>
    <p>Measuring data quality is a complex issue and ARX supports multiple models that can be used as objective functions for optimizing
    the output data of an anonymization process. Typically, these models define a decrease in data quality as an increase in information
		loss, which can be quantified. ARX supports quality models, which measure quality based on individual cell values, attributes 
		or records and a workload-aware model focusing on the generation of classification models.</p>
	<p>Cell-oriented and attribute-oriented models can be parameterized with different aggregate functions, which define how the individual
		measures will be compiled into a global measure for the overall dataset. The following aggregate functions are available:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Rank: Ordered list of measurements for all attributes, which will be compared lexicographically.</li>
		<li>Geometric mean: The geometric mean of the measurements for all attributes.</li>
		<li>Arithmetic mean: The arithmetic mean of the measurements for all attributes.</li>
		<li>Sum: The sum of the measurements for all attribute</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Cell-oriented and attribute-oriented measures can further parameterized with attribute weights, which specify the importance of the
	   attributes for further analyses. ARX will try to reduce the degree of transformation that is applied to attributes with higher importance.</p>
	<h4>Cell-oriented models</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Granularity/loss</em>: This measure summarizes the degree to which transformed attribute values cover the original domain of an attribute.
		ARX implements sophisticated methods for quantifying this coverage based on functional representations of generalization rules.
		Moreover, the model can be parameterized to influence the degree of generalization and suppression that will be applied to a dataset.

		<li><em>Precision</em>: This model estimates data quality based on normalized generalization levels of transformed attribute values.
		More information can be found here: <em>http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S021848850200165X</em>.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Attribute-oriented models</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Non-uniform entropy</em>: This model quantifies loss of information based on mutual information, which measures the amount of 
		information that can be obtained about the original values of variables in the input dataset by observing the values of variables in
		the output dataset. The non-uniform variant implemented in ARX is described here: <em>http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2008.129</em></li>
		<li><em>Height</em>: This very simple model quantifies loss of information as the sum of the generalization levels applied to all attribute values.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Record-oriented models</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Average equivalence class size</em>: This model estimates data quality by calculating the average size of classes of indistinguishable
		records. It does not take into account the actual values attributes in the output dataset. More
		information can be found here: <em>http://research.cs.wisc.edu/techreports/viewreport.php?report=1521</em>.</li>
		<li><em>Discernibility</em>: This model also estimates data quality based on the size of the equivalence classes in the output dataset.
		Records which are suppressed are penalized. It does not take into account the actual values attributes in the output dataset.

		<li><em>Ambiguity</em>: This model quantifies the degree to which the records in the output dataset are ambiguous. 
		More information can be found here: <em>http://www.tdp.cat/issues/tdp.a047a10.pdf</em>.</li>
		<li><em>Entropy-based model</em>: This model has been proposed in <em>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120592</em>.</li>

	<p>ARX also implements a model for maximizing the data publisher's benefit following the game-theoretic approach implemented in the
	profitability privacy model. For further details, please refer to  <em>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120592</em> and
	<em>https://knowledge.amia.org/65881-amia-1.3897810/t003-1.3901461/f003-1.3901462/2732143-1.3901626/2731708-1.3901623</em>.</p>
	<p>Since version 3.7.0 ARX further implements a model for optimizing output data towards suitability as a training set for building
	classification models. For more details, please refer to: <em>https://doi.org/10.1145/775047.775089</em>.</p>
