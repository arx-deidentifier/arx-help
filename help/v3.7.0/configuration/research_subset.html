    <h4>Defining a research sample</h4>
    <p>In this view, a research sample can be specified. It represents a sample of the overall dataset that will be
        anonymized and exported. This feature can be used to anonymize data using a population table. Privacy models that
        can consider this information include &delta;-presence, k-map and the game-theoretic approach. It is also considered
        by some methods for risk analysis. The buttons in the top-right corner provide access to different options for 
        extracting a sample from the data set:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Selecting no records.</li>
        <li>Selecting all records.</li>
        <li>Selecting records by matching the current data set against an external data set.</li>
        <li>Selecting records by querying the data set.</li>
        <li>Selecting records by random sampling.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The view will show the size of the current sample and the method with which it was created. At any
       time, the research sample can be altered by clicking the checkboxes shown in the data tables. The query syntax
       is as follows: fields and constants must be enclosed in single quotes. In the example 'age' is a field and '50'
       is a constant. The following operators are supported: &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, =, or, and, ( and ). The dialog
       dynamically shows the number of rows matching the query and displays error messages in case of syntactic errors.
