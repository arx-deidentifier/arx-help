    <h4>Privacy models</h4>
    <p>This area allows to select and configure the privacy models that are to be used to de-identify the data set.
       Privacy criteria can be added or removed by clicking the plus and minus buttons respectively.
       The third button allows to change their parameterization. With the up- and down-arrows it is possible to transfer
       parameterizations between privacy models against attribute disclosure.</p>

    <p>Most buttons will bring up the following configuration dialog. Here, the down-arrow can be used to select a
       parameterization out of a set of common parametrizations for the selected privacy model.</p>

    <p> k-Anonymity, k-Map, &delta;-presence, risk-based privacy models and differential privacy apply to all quasi-identifiers and can therefore
        always be enabled. In contrast, l-diversity, t-closeness and &delta;-disclosure privacy are associated with specific
        sensitive attributes. They can thus only be enabled if a sensitive attribute is currently selected.
        Models that will be used to de-identify the data set are displayed in the table.</p>
    <p> Note: If "hierarchical distance" is used as a ground-distance for &delta;-presence, a generalization hierarchy must be 
        specified for the respective attribute.</p>
    <p> Note: k-Map, and &delta;-presence require specifying a research sample and population data.</p>
    <p> Note: If a model based on population uniqueness is used, the underlying population must also be specified.</p>
