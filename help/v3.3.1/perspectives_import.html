    <h4>Import and export of data</h4>
    <p>Generalization hierarchies and datasets can be exported as and imported from files containing character
        separated values (CSV), which allows to exchange data with common tools such as spreadsheet programs. For loading data
        into ARX, further data sources are supported. This includes MS Excel spreadsheets and data from relational
        database systems, such as MS SQL, DB2, MySQL or PostgreSQL. Data import is performed with a dedicated wizard,
        which is shown in the following image.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.3.1/img/import_data.png" alt="Import" width="308" height="265" />
    <p>In addition to access to different types of data sources, this wizard supports renaming and hiding columns, as
        well as changing their order. Data types are automatically detected and data cleansing may be performed. This
        means that values that do not conform to the selected data type will be replaced with null values. Missing
        values are handled correctly by all methods provided in the ARX tool.</p>
