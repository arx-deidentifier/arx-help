    <h4>Privacy models, population properties, costs and benefits of data sharing</h4>
    <p>Privacy models can be selected and configured in the following view:</p>
    <img src="../img/ch3-configuration/p0304_01_configure-1.png" alt="Privacy models tab" width="513" height="85" /> 
    <p>Models that have been selected are shown in the table.
       Privacy models can be added or removed by clicking the plus or minus button, respectively.
       The third button brings up a dialog for parameterization.</p> 
    <p>Most buttons will bring up the following configuration dialog. Here, the arrow pointing downwards can be used to select a
       parameterization out of a set of presets for the selected privacy model.</p>

    <p> k-Anonymity, k-Map, &delta;-presence, risk-based privacy models, differential privacy and the game-theoretic model focus on quasi-identifiers and they can therefore
        always be enabled. In contrast, l-diversity, t-closeness, &beta;-likeness and &delta;-disclosure privacy focus on
        sensitive attributes. They can thus only be enabled if a sensitive attribute has been selected. Some models further
        require particular settings (e.g. a value generalization hierarchy must be specified to be able to use t-closeness
        with hierarchical ground distance. Some privacy models (e.g. k-map and &delta;-presence) require 
        a population table, which is supported in ARX by defining the dataset which is to be anonymized as a 
        (research) sample of the dataset which has been loaded.</p>
    <p> Note: If a model based on population uniqueness is used, properties of the underlying population must also be 
        specified. This is supported by the following section of the perspective:</p>
    <img src="../img/ch3-configuration/p0304_03_configure-2.png" alt="Population tab" width="566" height="99" /> 
    <p>Note: Models based on population uniqueness assume that the dataset is a uniform sample of the population.
        If this is not the case, results may be inaccurate.</p>
    <p> Note: The game-theoretic model is based on a cost/benefit analysis and therefore requires the specification 
        of various parameters which can be found in an associated section of the perspective:</p>
    <img src="../img/ch3-configuration/p0304_04_configure-3.png" alt="Costs tab" width="568" height="101" /> 
    <p>Here, the following parameters must be specified:</p>
 	<ol>
        <li><em>Adversary cost:</em> the amount of money needed by an attacker for trying to re-identify a single record.</li>
        <li><em>Adversary gain:</em> the amount of money earned by an attacker for successfully re-identifying a single record.</li>
        <li><em>Publisher benefit:</em> the amount of money earned by the data publisher for publishing a single record.</li>
        <li><em>Publisher loss:</em> the amount of money lost by the data publisher, e.g. due to a fine, if a single record is attacked successfully.</li>
	</ol>
