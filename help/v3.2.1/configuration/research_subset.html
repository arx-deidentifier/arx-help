    <h4>Defining a research data set (area 5)</h4>
    <p>In this view, a research subset can be specified. It represents a subset if the overall data set that will be
        anonymized and exported. It is possible to enforce d-presence on the subset. Three buttons in the
        top-right corner support different options:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Selecting no data entries</li>
        <li>Selecting all data entries</li>
        <li>Selecting some entries, by matching the data set against a data set from an external file</li>
        <li>Selecting some entries by querying the data set</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The view will show the size of the currently selected subset and the way in which it was created. At any
        time, the research subset can be altered by clicking the checkboxes shown in the data tables. The query syntax
        is as follows. Fields and constants must be enclosed in single quotes. In the example 'age' is a field and '50'
        is a constant. The following operators are supported: &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, =, or, and, ( and ). The dialog
        dynamically shows the number of rows matching the query and displays error messages in case of syntactic errors.

    <p>In the data views (area 1), the research subset is indicated by the checkboxes. These can also be dynamically
       edited in the view for the input data set.</p>
