    <h3>Gobal settings</h3>
    <p>
        The settings window is accessible from either the application menu or the application toolbar. The <em>Project</em>
        tab allows to alter general project properties. The <em>I/O settings</em> tab allows to configure basic
        properties for the import and export of data. The <em>Transformation</em> tab can be utilized to alter some
        aspects of the data transformations performed by the tool. When <em>remove outliers</em> is checked, the values
        of the quasi-identifiers are remove for tuples that are outliers. Otherwise, these values are preserved. To this
        end, these values are replaced by the <em>suppression string</em>. The <em>maximum size of the search space</em> defines an
        upper bound for the number of possible transformations, which is defined by the number of quasi-identifiers and
        the heights of their generalization hierarchies.

        The <em>Internals</em> tab allows to adjust some parameters of the optimizations employed by the framework.
        Changing the <em>number of snapshots</em> enables users to control a space-time-tradeoff provided by the framework.
        Choosing a value of <em>1</em> greatly reduces the main memory requirements of the tool, while leading to
        potentially significantly increased execution times. Choosing a larger value will reduce execution times, but
        increase memory consumption. The default value is <em>200</em>. The <em>Visualization</em> tab allows to control the
        lattice viewer from the data exploration perspective. The <em>Risk analysis</em> tab allows defining parameter for risk based anonymization.
        The <em>Solver</em> tab allows to specify parameters for the Newton-Raphson method used for population based
        risk models.
