    <h4>Interoperability</h4>
    <p>ARX aims at providing a high degree of interoperability with other software systems. 
       Generalization hierarchies and data sets can be imported and exported from and to files containing character
       separated values (CSV). Moreover, ARX is able to import data from further sources, including MS Excel spreadsheets and 
       relational database systems, such as MS SQL, DB2, MySQL or PostgreSQL.</p>

    <p>The data import wizard also supports the renaming, removing and reordering of columns.
       During data import, data types are automatically detected and data cleansing may be performed. This means that values that do not conform to the 
       specified data type will be replaced with null values, which are handled correctly by all methods implemented in ARX.</p>
    <p>For further analyzing data provided by ARX with other tools, all tables can be exported into CSV formatted data via context menus.</p>
