    <h4>Population settings</h4>
 	    <p>Methods for estimating the number of population uniques in a data set require some basic data about the population
 	    from which the data set was sampled. ARX provides default settings for populations, such as the USA, UK, France or Germany,
 	    which can be selected in the following area:</p>
        <img src="/help/v3.5.2/img/risk/risk-9.png" alt="Population model" width="570" height="142" />
        <p>It is important that the underlying population matches the population that the anticipated adversary is likely to
        know that the data has been sampled from. If the required data is not provided by ARX, it can also
        be entered manually.</p>
