    <h4>Properties of transformations</h4>
    <p>Basic information about the currently selected transformation will be displayed in this view. The highest and
       lowest scores are shown as absolute values and as values relative to the highest and lowest
       scores of all transformations in the solution space.</p>
     <img src="../img/ch4-exploration/p0404_01_properties.png" alt="Properties" width="519" height="218" /> 
     <p>The view also displays the number of successors
        and predecessors of a transformation, the generalization levels which are specified for the quasi-identifiers and whether the
        transformation has been pruned during the anonymization process.</p>
    <p>Please note that since version 3.7.0 ARX supports a local transformation method which applies different
       transformation schemes to different parts of the input dataset. If this option is used, this view will display
       additional properties of the individual transformations applied, such as the number of affected records.</p>
