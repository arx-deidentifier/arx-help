    <h4>5.9. Data quality models</h4>
    <p>This section displays measures of data quality obtained for output data using various general-purpose models.
       In addition, the data types of attributes as well as the fraction of missing values is presented.</p>
    <p>Note: All measures presented in this view have been scaled and normalized into the range [0, 1] where 0 represents
       a dataset from which all information has been removed and 1 represents the unmodified input dataset.
       Consequently, higher values returned for the quality models are always better.</p>
    <p>The view at the top shows attribute-level quality, i.e. quality estimates that relate to individual
       quasi-identifiers. The view at the bottom shows data-level quality, i.e. quality estimates for the
       overall set of quasi-identifiers.</p>

    <p>Note that not all quality measures are necessarily supported for all attributes or datasets. If a quality measure
       could not be evaluated for an attribute, the result is displayed as "N/A" in the upper table. As a consequence,
       this attribute has also been ignored when calculating data-level quality using the same model.</p>
    <p>The following attribute-level quality models are currently implemented:</p>
	<ol>
	    <li><em>Precision:</em> Measures the generalization intensity of attribute values. For details see: Sweeney, L.: Achieving k-anonymity privacy protection using generalization and suppression. J. Uncertain. Fuzz. Knowl. Sys. 10 (5), p. 571-588 (2002).</li>
        <li><em>Granularity:</em> Captures the granularity of data. For details see: Iyengar, V.: Transforming data to satisfy privacy constraints. Proc. Int. Conf. Knowl. Disc. Data Mining, p. 279-288 (2002).</li>
        <li><em>Non-Uniform Entropy:</em> Quantifies differences in the distributions of attribute values. For details see: Prasser, F., Bild, R., Kuhn, K.A.: A Generic Method for Assessing the Quality of De-Identified Health Data. Proc. Med. Inf. Europe (2016). and  De Waal, A., Willenborg, L.:  Information loss through global recoding and local suppression. Netherlands Off. Stat., vol. 14, p. 17-20 (1999).</li>
        <li><em>Squared error:</em> Interprets values as numbers and captures the sum of squared errors in groups of indistinguishable records. For details see: Soria-Comas, J., et al.: T-closeness through microaggregation: Strict privacy with enhanced utility preservation. IEEE Trans. Knowl. Data Eng., 27(11), p. 3098-3110 (2015).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In addition, the following dataset-level quality models are available:</p>
	<ol>
	    <li><em>Average class size:</em> Measures the average size of groups of indistinguishable records. For details see: LeFevre, K., DeWitt, D., Ramakrishnan, R.: Mondrian multidimensional k-anonymity. Proc. Int. Conf. Data Engineering (2006).</li>
        <li><em>Discernibility:</em> Measures the size of groups of indistinguishable records and introduces a penalty for records which have been completely suppressed. For details see: Bayardo, R., Agrawal, R.: Data privacy through optimal k-anonymization. Proc. Int. Conf. Data Engineering, p. 217-228 (2005).</li>
        <li><em>Ambiguity:</em> Captures the ambiguity of records. For details see: Goldberger, Tassa.: Efficient Anonymizations with Enhanced Utility. Trans. Data. Priv.</li>
        <li><em>Record-level squared error:</em> Interprets records as vectors and captures the sum of squared errors in groups of indistinguishable records. For details see: D. Sanchez, S. Martinez, and J. Domingo-Ferrer.: Comment on unique in the shopping mall: On the reidentifiability of credit card metadata. Science, 351(6279):1274-1274, 2016.</li>
