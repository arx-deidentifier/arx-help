    <h4>Local recoding</h4>
    <p>This section of ARX's utility analysis perspective enables users to perform local transformation (involving multiple transformation methods, e.g. 
       generalization and aggregation) to further enhance the quality of output data obtained via a primary anonymization procedure. It is 
       recommended to perform primary anonymization using a suppression limit of 100% and a configuration which favors suppression over 
       other types of data transformation. The latter can be configured by moving the slider in the "coding model" section of the configuration 
       perspective to the leftmost position. Then, local recoding can be performed in this perspective with various methods. It is 
       recommended to use the default configuration (slider moved almost to the left, method: fixpoint-adaptive with parameter 0.05).</p>

    <p>ARX will perform local recoding by recursively executing a global transformation algorithm on records that have been suppressed
       in the previous iteration. With this method, a significant improvement in data quality can be achieved, even in comparison
       to other local transformation algorithms. Moreover, the method supports a wide variety of privacy models, 
       including models for protecting data from attribute disclosure.</p>
    <p>Please note that local transformation is supported more explicitly since version 3.7.0 of ARX and that this view
       is typically not needed anymore.</p>
