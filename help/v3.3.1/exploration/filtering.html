    <h4>Filtering the solution space</h4>
    <p>The  screen shot shows controls for filtering the subset of the solution space that will be displayed in this perspective. First, a
       quasi-identifier can be selected and transformations can be restricted to ones defining the selected generalization levels for the 
       selected quasi identifier. Second, the displayed transformations can be restricted to
       transformations that do or do not preserve privacy according to the specified privacy model.</p>

    <p>The sliders at the bottom allow to display only
       transformations with an information loss that is in between the con screen shotd minimum and maximum bounds. Note that
       the information loss of transformations that have not been checked explicitly are not known to the tool and that they are
       therefore estimated with bounding intervals that are computed from their successors and predecessors.
       These estimates might be wrong when an approximate de-identification process has been performed.</p>
