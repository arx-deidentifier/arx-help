    <h4>Summary statistics</h4>
    <p>The first tab on the bottom of the utility analysis perspective shows summary statistics for the 
       currently selected attribute.</p>
    <img src="../img/ch5-utility/p0502_01_analyze_11.png" alt="Summary statistics" width="575" />
    <p>The displayed parameters depend on the scale of measure of the variable. 
       For attributes with a nominal scale, the following parameters will be provided:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For attributes with an ordinal scale, the following additional parameters will be displayed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Median, minimum, maximum.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For attributes with an interval scale, the following additional parameters will be provided:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic mean, sample variance, population variance, standard deviation, range, kurtosis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For attributes with a ratio scale, the following additional parameters will be displayed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Geometric mean.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: These statistical parameters are calculated using <em>list-wise deletion</em>, which is a method for handling missing data. 
       With this method, an entire record is excluded from analysis if any single value is missing. This behavior can
       be changed in the project settings.</p>
