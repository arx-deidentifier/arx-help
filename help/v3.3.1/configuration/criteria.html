    <h4>Privacy model (area 3)</h4>
    <p>This area allows to configure the privacy model and the measure that is to be used for estimating data utility.
        Privacy criteria can be enabled and disabled by clicking the plus and minus buttons respectively.</p>

    <p> k-Anonymity, k-Map, δ-presence, risk-based privacy models and differential privacy apply to all quasi-identifiers and can therefore
        always be enabled. In contrast, l-diversity, t-closeness and δ-disclosure privacy are associated with specific
        sensitive attributes. They can thus only be enabled if a sensitive attribute is currently selected (area 2).
        Models that will be used to de-identify the dataset are displayed in the table.</p>
    <p> Note: if "hierarchical distance" is used as a ground-distance for d-presence, a generalization hierarchy must be 
        specified for the respective attribute.</p>
    <p> Note: k-Map, and δ-presence require specifying a research sample and population data (area 5).</p>
    <p> Note: if a model based on population uniques is used, the underlying population must also be specified (area 3).</p>
