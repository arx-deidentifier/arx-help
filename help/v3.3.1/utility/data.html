    <h3>Classification accuracy</h3>
    <p>This section can be used to compare the classification accuracy achieved with a generic implementation of logistic regression for
       both the input and the output data set. The results are obtained with 10-fold cross-validation.
       In the view displayed at the bottom, the features and classes that are to be analyzed can be selected.</p>

    <p>The section in displayed at the bottom shows the results of the classification process. For input as well as output data, it displays
       the number of instances of the class attribute as well as a baseline accuracy. For the input data set the baseline accuracy is ZeroR, for
       the output data set it is the accuracy of logistic regression with the input data set. For the output data set, the view also displays
       the difference in the number of instances of the class attribute. </p>
