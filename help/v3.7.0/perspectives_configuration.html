    <h4>Configuration perspective</h4>
    <p>In the configuration perspective, data can be imported, transformation rules can be created, and privacy as well as quality models
       can be selected and parameterized. Input data is always displayed on the left hand side.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/configure_view_1.png" alt="Configuration perspective" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>The data import wizard supports a variety of data sources and allows the specify meta data, such as data types and formats.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/import_data.png" alt="Import" width="308" height="265" />
    <p>ARX is able to import data from other CSV files, MS Excel spreadsheets and relational database systems, such as MS SQL, DB2, MySQL or PostgreSQL.</p>
    <p>The data import wizard also supports the renaming, removing and reordering of columns.
       During data import, data types are automatically detected and data cleansing may be performed. This means that values that do not conform to the 
       specified data type will be replaced with specific null values, which are handled correctly by all methods implemented in ARX.</p>
    <p>All tabular data displayed by ARX can be exported into CSV files via context menus.</p>
    <p>ARX uses value generalization hierarchies to implement a wide variety of data transformation methods. These hierarchies
       can either be created within the software (via specific wizards) or imported from CSV files. Hierarchies created with ARX
       can also be exported to CSV files.</p>
    <p>Further views in this perspective can be used to specify all further parameters needed for anonymization. The most
       important views cover privacy models, quality models and data transformation methods.</p>
