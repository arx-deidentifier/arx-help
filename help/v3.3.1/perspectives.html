    <h3>Overview of the ARX's perspectives</h3>
    <p>The ARX anonymization tool is divided into four perspectives, which model different aspects of the
       de-identification process. As is shown in the below figure, these steps consist of 1) configuring privacy
        models, utility measures and transformation methods, 2) exploring the solution space and 3) analyzing data utility and
        4) analyzing re-identification risks. In the configuration perspective, input data can be loaded, transformation rules can be specified
        and all further parameters, such as privacy and utility models, can be parameterized. When the solution space has been
        characterized by executing a de-identification algorithm, the exploration perspective supports searching for
        privacy-preserving data transformations that fulfill the user's requirements. To assess suitability, the utility
        analysis perspective allows comparing transformed data sets to the original input data set with methods of descriptive
        statistics and machine learning. Finally, risk analyses can be performed for input data sets as well as their transformed
        representations. Based on these analyses, a suitable solution candidate can be selected or the
        configuration of the de-identification process can be modified.</p>
