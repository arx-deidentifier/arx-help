    <h4>Configuring the anonymization process</h4>
    <p>In this perspective, first, a data set can be imported into the tool and attribute meta data can be specified,
       including data types and attribute properties in terms of privacy risks.
       Second, generalization hierarchies for quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes can be created
       semi-automatically with built-in wizards or imported into the tool from CSV files. Third, privacy models, the method for
       measuring data utility and further parameters, which control the transformation process, can be
       specified.</p>

    <p>The perspective is divided into five main areas. Area 1 shows the current input data set, area 2 provides means for
        specifying meta data about its attributes, area 3 supports configuring the privacy model, area 4 implements
        controls for configuring further properties of the transformation process, such as the coding model, how data utility 
        should be measured and how important certain attributes are. Area 5 provides methods for extracting a research sample, 
        which is a subset of the overall data set that is to be de-identified and exported.</p>
