    <h3>Attributes and generalization hierarchies (area 2)</h3>
    <p>This area allows to assign attribute types and data types to columns and to specify the generalization
        hierarchies and/or microaggregation functions for quasi-identifying and sensitive attributes. As is shown in area
        2.1, each tab is associated with one attribute of the input data set. The dropdown list in area 2.2 supports
        specifying the type of the attribute, whereas the dropdown list in area 2.3 allows to specify a data type.
        Specifying a data type is optional but yields better results when creating generalization hierarchies via ARX's
        built-in wizard and when visualizing data properties in the analysis perspective. While ARX will happily treat
        all data as strings, please note that specifying a data type can be important for generating meaningful
        generalization hierarchies and obtaining a more intuitive graphical representation of data properties.
        Currently, the following data types are supported:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>String: a generic sequence of characters. This is the default data type.</li>
        <li>Integer: a data type for numbers without a fractional component.</li>
        <li>Decimal: a data type for numbers with fractional component.</li>
        <li>Date/time: a data type for dates and timestamps.</li>
        <li>Ordered string: this data type represents strings with ordinal scale.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Some data types require a format string, which can be specified in area 2.4. Integers and dates/time stamps are
        typical examples. More information on format strings for decimals can be found <a title="Decimal format"
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html" target="_blank">here</a> and
        information on format strings for dates/timestamps can be found <a title="Date format"
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p> In Area 2.5 the coding model can be configured. Generalization and microaggregation are supported. The
        drop-down lists in area 2.6 allow specifying minimal and maximal generalization levels for the selected
        attribute if generalization is selected as a coding model. In case of microaggregation, this
        area allows to choose the aggregate function and the way how missing data entries should be
        handled. </p>
    </p>Area 2.7 displays a tabular representation of the associated generalization hierarchy.
        The values from the original input data set are shown in the first column and the level of generalization
        increases from left to right. This area also implements a basic editor for generalization hierarchies, which
        allows to move, add and delete columns or rows and to alter the labels of individual cells. Please note that
        any generalization hierarchy must be a mono-hierarchy (i.e. it must form a tree structure).
        As a starting point for defining generalization hierarchies, ARX offers a wizard, which can be used to create 
        generalization hierarchies for many common types of attributes. The wizard can be launched via the application 
        menu or via an associated button in the application toolbar.</p>
