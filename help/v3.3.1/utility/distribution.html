    <h4>Empirical distribution</h4>
    <p>This section shows a histogram or a table visualizing the frequency distribution of the values of the currently selected attribute.</p>

    <p>Note: ARX tries to present comparable data visualizations of properties of the original and transformed data sets. For this purpose, it
       uses information from the attributes' data types and relationships between values extracted from the
       generalization hierarchies. As a consequence, specifying reasonable data types and hierarchies will increase the quality
       and comparability of data visualizations.</p>
