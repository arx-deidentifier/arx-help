    <h4>Exploration perspective</h4>
    <p>During the anonymization process, ARX characterizes a solution space of potential transformations of the
    input dataset. For each solution candidate it is determined whether risk thresholds are met and data quality
    is quantified according to the given model. This perspective allows users to browse the result of
    this process and to select interesting transformations for further analysis.</p>

    <p>Please note that since version 3.7.0 ARX supports a local transformation method which applies different
    transformation schemes to different parts of the input dataset. In this case, the exploration perspective
    displays the individual transformations applied to the dataset.</p>
