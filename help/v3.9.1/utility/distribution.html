    <h4>Empirical distribution</h4>
    <p>This view shows a histogram or a table visualizing the frequency distribution of the values of the currently selected attribute.</p>
    <p>From Wikipedia: In statistics, a frequency distribution is a table that displays the frequency of various outcomes in a sample. 
    Each entry in the table contains the frequency or count of the occurrences of values within a particular group or interval, and 
    in this way, the table summarizes the distribution of values in the sample.</p>
	<p>From Wikipedia: A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability 
	distribution of a continuous variable. To construct a histogram, the first step is to "bin" the range of values - that 
	is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals - and then count how many values fall into each interval.</p>

    <p>Note: ARX tries to present comparable data visualizations of properties of the original and transformed data sets. For this purpose, it
       uses information from the attributes' data types and relationships between its values, which are extracted from the
       generalization hierarchies. As a consequence, specifying reasonable data types and hierarchies will increase the quality
       and comparability of data visualizations.</p>

    <p>Note: The table view can be activated using "manage items" buttons on the top right.</p>
