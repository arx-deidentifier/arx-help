    <h4>Classification performance</h4>
    <p>This view can be used to configure classification models and their parameters as well as to compare the 
    performance of these models trained on input and anonymized output data. Please note that ARX supports a specific quality
    model for optimizing output data towards suitability as a training set for model generation.</p>
    
    <p>In the view displayed at the bottom left, feature and target variables can be selected and feature scaling functions may be specified:</p>

    <p>In the view displayed at the bottom right different types of classification models can be selected and configured:</p>
    <img src="../img/ch5-utility/p0508_02_analyze_18.png" alt="Classification models"  width="567" height="194 /> 
    <p>ARX currently supports the following types of classification models:</p>
       <ol>
    	<li>Logistic regression</li>
        <li>Random forest</li>
        <li>Naive Bayes</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At the top, two different views can be selected by tabs ("Overview" and "ROC curves"). For input as
    well as output data, these views show different results of the performance analysis. Performance measures are typically
    expressed relative to the performance of a trivial ZeroR classifier trained on unmodified input data and the selected type of model 
    also trained on input data. Results are obtained using k-fold cross-validation.</p>
    <p>The tables in the view "Overview" display (relative) classification accuracies as well as sensitivity, specificity and Brier score:</p>

    <p>The plots and tables in the view "ROC Curves", display ROC curves and the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for selected instances of the target variable:</p>
    <img src="../img/ch5-utility/p0508_04_analyze_20.png" alt="Classification accuracy"  width="567" height="423 /> 
    <p>Please note that ARX uses an one-vs-all approach to calculate performance measures for multinomial classifiers.</p>
