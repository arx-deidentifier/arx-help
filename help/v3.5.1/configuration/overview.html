    <h4>Configuring the de-identification process</h4>
    <p>In the configuration perspective, data can be imported, generalization hierarchies can be created, and the anonymization process
       can be parameterized.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.5.1/img/configuration/overview.png" alt="Configuration view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>The perspective is divided into five main areas.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Area 1 shows the current input data set -</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The data import process supports a variety of data sources including Excel, JDBC databases and character separated value files with user defined syntax.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Area 2 provides a means to specify attribute meta-data and view generalization hierarchies -</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For each attribute, data type, data format, and sensitivity can be specified.</li>
            <li>Generalization hierarchies can be created in interval, ordinal and mask form for quasi-identifier and sensitive attributes.  Hierarchies can be created with software assistance or imported from CSV files.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Area 3 supports the configuration of privacy models -</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple privacy models can be selected and configured.  For applicable models, population and financial data can also be specified.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Area 4 supports the configuration of utility measures -</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A single utility measure can be selected and configured.  For applicable utility measures, suppression, generalization, aggregation, monotonicity and precomputation threshold can also be specified.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Area 5 provides methods for extracting a research sample, which is a subset of the overall data set that is to be de-identified and exported -</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The research subset can be select manually, randomly, by query or by file</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
