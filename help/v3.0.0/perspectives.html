    <h3>Overview of the different perspectives</h3>
    <p>The ARX anonymization tool is divided into four perspectives, which model different aspects of the
        anonymization process. As is depicted in the Figure shown below, these steps consist of 1) configuring privacy
        criteria and transformation methods, 2) exploring the solution space and 3) analyzing data in terms of utility
        and re-identification risks. In the configuration phase, input data is loaded, transformation rules are imported
        or created and all further parameters, such as privacy criteria, are specified. When the solution space has been
        characterized by executing an anonymization algorithm, the exploration phase supports searching for
        privacy-preserving data transformations that fulfill the user's requirements. To assess suitability, the utility
        analysis phase allows comparing transformed data sets to the original input data set with methods of descriptive
        statistics. Finally, risk-analyses can be performed for input data sets as well as their transformed
        representations. Based on these analyses, further solution candidates might be considered and analyzed, or the
        configuration of the anonymization process can be altered.</p>
