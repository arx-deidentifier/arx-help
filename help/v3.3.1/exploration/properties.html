    <p>Basic information about the currently selected transformation will be displayed in the this area. The minimal
        and maximal reduction in data utility are shown as absolute values and as values relative to the minimal and maximal
        information loss of all transformations in the solution space. Furthermore, the view displays the number of successors
        and predecessors of a transformation, the generalization levels which are specified for the quasi-identifiers and whether the
        transformation has been pruned during the de-identification process.</p>
