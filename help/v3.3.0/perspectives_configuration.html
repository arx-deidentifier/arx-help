    <p>In this section, firstly, a data set can be imported into the tool and attributes can be characterized.
        Secondly, generalization hierarchies for quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes can be generated
        semi-automatically by means of a wizard or imported into the tool. Thirdly, privacy criteria, the method for
        measuring data utility and further parameters, such as parameters of the transformation process, can be
