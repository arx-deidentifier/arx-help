    <h3>Analyzing re-identification risk</h3>
    <p>In this perspective the re-identification risks of an input or output dataset can be analyzed with several
        sample-based or population-based models. Area 1 shows data about the equivalence classes of the original
        dataset, whereas area 2 shows the same data about the transformed dataset. Area 3 and 4 are showing additional
        risk information about the original and transformed dataset respectively.</p>
