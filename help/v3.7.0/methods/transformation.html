    <h4>Supported transformation methods</h4>
     <p>ARX supports top- and bottom-coding, generalization, microaggregation and suppression. When generalization is selected, 
     minimum and maximum generalization levels can be specified. Microaggregation may be performed with or without prior 
     clustering using the specified value generalization hierarchies. Moreover, the aggregation function and how missing
     values should be handled can be specified.</p>
