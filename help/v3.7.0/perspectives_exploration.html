    <h4>Exploration of the solution space</h4>
    <p>During the de-identification process, ARX constructs a search space consisting of a set of transformations that
       can be applied to the datasets. This search space is then characterized based on the
       given privacy models and utility measure. This perspective allows users to browse the solution candidates
       identified by ARX and to select interesting transformations for further analysis.</p>
