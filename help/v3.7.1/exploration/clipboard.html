    <h4>Organizing transformations</h4>
    <p>This view contains a clipboard, which can be used to organize and annotate transformations. Right-clicking an
       entry opens up a context menu, which allows to remove the transformation, apply it to the current dataset and to
       edit its annotations.</p>

    <p>The buttons in the upper right corner support removing all entries, changing their order
       and sorting them according to the resulting reductions in data utility.</p>
    <p>Please note that since version 3.7.0 ARX supports a local transformation method which applies different
       transformation schemes to different parts of the input dataset. If this option is used, this view will be
       disabled.</p>
