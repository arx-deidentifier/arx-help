    <p>Basic information about the currently selected transformation will be displayed in the this area. The minimal
        and maximal loss in data utility are shown as absolute values and as values relative to the minimal and maximal
        information loss in the overall generalization lattice. Furthermore, the view displays the number of successors
        and predecessors of the transformation, the generalization levels of the quasi-identifiers and whether the
        transformation has been checked explicitly.</p>
