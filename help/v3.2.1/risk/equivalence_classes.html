    <h4>Analyzing equivalence class sizes (area 1 &amp; area 2)</h4>
    <p>In this view, the distribution of sizes of equivalence classes (or cells) can be analyzed. The distribution
        is displayed for both input and output.</p>

    <p> The data may be displayed as a histogram or as a table.</p>

    <h4>Analyzing quasi-identifiers (area 1 &amp; area 2)</h4>
    <p>In the following view, combinations of attributes may be analyzed for associated risks of re-identification.
        This analysis uses estimates of uniqueness either based on the sample or on a super-population model. You may
        specify this in the settings dialog. First, you must select a set of attributes to analyze in the bottom left area.
        ARX will then determine the average risk of re-identification that is associated with the power set of the
        selected set of attributes. You may use this information to decide which quasi-identifiers need to be protected
        in your dataset.</p>
