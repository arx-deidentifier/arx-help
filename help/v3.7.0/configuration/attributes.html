    <h4>Specifying attribute properties</h4>
    <p>Attribute properties are set in the Transformation and Metadata tabs within the Configuration tab.  To set an attribute's properties, first select an 
    attribute in the input tab (e.g. age in the figure below).  The transformation and metadata tabs will be linked with that attribute and updated accordingly.</p>

    <h4>Transformation Tab</h4>
    <p>The transformation tab is used to set the type of privacy risk and transformation method associated with an attribute.  The transformation tab 
    also displays an attribute's generalization hierarchy and provides a context menu for in-place editing.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/configuration/transformation.png" alt="Transformation" width="570" height="211" />
    <p>Types of privacy risk include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Identifying attributes</em> are associated with a high risk of re-identification. They will be removed from the data set. Typical examples are names or Social Security Numbers.</li>
        <li><em>Quasi-identifying attributes</em> are associated with a high risk of re-identification. They will be transformed by means of generalization, suppression or micro-aggregation. Typical examples are gender, date of birth and ZIP codes.</li>
        <li><em>Sensitive attributes</em> encode properties with which individuals are not willing to be linked with. As such, they might be of interest to an attacker and, if disclosed, could cause harm to data subjects. They will be kept unmodified but may be subject to further constraints, such as t-closeness or l-diversity. Typical examples are diagnoses.</li>
        <li><em>Insensitive attributes</em> are not associated with any privacy risks. They will be kept unmodified.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The assigned risk type is also indicated by a color coded bullet, next to the attribute name, in the input tab.</p>
    <p>Since version 3.7.0 there are also specific buttons that can be used to assign a certain attribute type to all attributes in the dataset.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/configuration/shortcut.png" alt="Shortcut" width="92" height="20" />
    <p>Transformation methods include generalization and micro-aggregation. When generalization is selected, minimum and maximum applicable generalization levels can
    be set. When micro-aggregation is selected, the aggregation function and handling of missing data can be set.</p>
    <p>When available, an attributes generalization hierarchy is displayed in tabular form, below the risk type and transformation inputs.  Attribute values in their most specific
    form are displayed in the leftmost column, with generalization levels increasing from left to right.  Right clicking in the hierarchy table displays an editor that can
    be used to create a simple hierarchy or perform row, column, and cell updates on an existing hierarchy.  To create a complex hierarchies, consider using the <em>Hierarchy Wizard</em>, 
    which can be launched from the Edit menu and application toolbar.</p>
    <h4>Metadata Tab</h4>
    <p>The metadata tab can be used to set the data type and format of an attribute.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.7.0/img/configuration/metadata.png" alt="Metadata" width="570" height="120" />
    <p>Supported data types include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>String: a generic sequence of characters. This is the default data type.</li>
        <li>Integer: a data type for numbers without a fractional component.</li>
        <li>Decimal: a data type for numbers with fractional component.</li>
        <li>Date/time: a data type for dates and time stamps.</li>
        <li>Ordinal: this data type represents variables with an ordinal scale.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Data type is set by right clicking on an attribute's row in the metadata table.  Format is prompted for automatically for applicable data types.
    Specifying a data type is optional, with String type used by default, but yields better results when creating generalization hierarchies and 
    visualizing data in the analysis perspective.</p>
    <p>Moreover, variables can be specified as potential response variables in modeling efforts that will be performed using output data.
    When combined with an appropriate data quality model, ARX will then try to minimize impacts on the structural relationships between
    quasi-identifying variables and the specified response variables.</p>
