    <h4>3. Configuring the anonymization process</h4>
    <p>In the configuration perspective, data can be imported and transformation rules, privacy models and utility
    measures can be selected and parameterized.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.9.1/img/configuration/overview.png" alt="Configuration view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>The perspective is divided into five main areas.</p>
    <em>Area 1</em> shows the current input dataset:
    <ul>
         <li>The table displays further information on specified attribute metadata.</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Area 2</em> provides a means to specify attribute metadata and view generalization hierarchies:
    <ul>
        <li>Attribute types and data types can be specified.</li>
        <li>Generalization hierarchies can be modified.</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Area 3</em> supports the configuration of privacy models:
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple privacy models can be selected and configured. Further parameters can be specified in dedicated tabs.</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Area 4</em> supports the configuration of utility measures:
    <ul>
        <li>A single utility measure can be configured and selected as an objective function.</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Area 5</em> provides methods for extracting a research sample:
    <ul>
    	<li>With this concept ARX supports the specification of population tables, by defining the dataset which is to
    	    be anonymized as a sample of the dataset that has been loaded.</li>
        <li>The sample can be selected manually, drawn randomly, or selected by query or by matching with another dataset.</li>
    </ul>
