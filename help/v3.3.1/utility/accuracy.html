    <h4>Classification accuracy</h4>
    <p>This section can be used to compare the classification accuracy that can be achieved with a generic implementation of logistic regression for
       both the input and the output data sets. The results are obtained with 10-fold cross-validation.
       In the view displayed at the bottom, the features and classes that are to be analyzed can be selected.</p>

    <p>The section displayed at the top shows the results of the classification process. For input as well as output data, it displays
       the number of instances of the class attribute as well as a baseline accuracy. For the input data set the baseline accuracy is defined as the accuracy
       that can be achieved with the ZeroR classification method. For the output data set the baseline accuracy is defined as the accuracy 
       that can be achieved when classifying the input data set. For output data, the view also displays
       the difference in the number of instances of the class attribute compared to the input data set. </p>
