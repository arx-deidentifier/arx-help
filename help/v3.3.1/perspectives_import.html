    <h4>Interoperability</h4>
    <p>With this wizard generalization hierarchies and data sets can be imported and exported from and to files containing character
       separated values (CSV). This allows to exchange data between ARX and common tools such as spreadsheet programs. ARX is able to
       import data from further sources, including MS Excel spreadsheets and data from relational
       database systems, such as MS SQL, DB2, MySQL or PostgreSQL.</p>

    <p>Apart from providing access to different types of data sources, this wizard also supports the renaming, removing and reordering of columns.
       Data types are automatically detected and data cleansing may be performed. This means that values that do not conform to the 
       specified data type will be replaced with null values, which are handled correctly by all methods implemented in ARX.</p>
    <p>To export data provided by ARX with external software, the data from all tables displayed by the tool can be exported into 
       CSV formatted data via context menus.</p>
