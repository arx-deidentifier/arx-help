    <h4>Filtering the solution space</h4>
    <p>This view supports selecting a set of transformations from the solution space that will be displayed in the exploration
       perspective. Transformations may be restricted to those with specific generalization levels for specific attributes
       or to those that do or do not fulfill the anonymity requirements.</p>

    <p>The sliders at the bottom can be used to select transformations with a score that is in between the 
       configured bounds. Note that the scores of transformations which have not been checked explicitly 
       are not known and that they are therefore estimated with bounding intervals that are computed from 
       other transformations in the solution space. These estimates might be wrong when a heuristic 
       anonymization process with a time limit has been performed.</p>
    <p>Please note that since version 3.7.0 ARX supports a local transformation method which applies different
       transformation schemes to different parts of the input dataset. If this option is used, this view will be
       disabled.</p>
