    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this perspective, first, a data set can be imported into the tool and attributes can be characterized.
        Second, generalization hierarchies for quasi-identifiers or sensitive attributes can be created
        automatically with wizards or imported into the tool. Thirdly, a privacy model, a transformation model and a
        utility measure can be specified and configured.</p>

    <p>The perspective is divided into five main areas. Area 1 shows the current input data set, area 2 supports
        specifying meta data about its attributes, area 3 supports configuring the privacy model, area 4 supports configuring
        further properties of the transformation process, such as the coding model, how data utility should be
        measured and how important certain attributes are. Area 5 allows defining a research sample, which is a subset
        of the overall population that is to be de-identified and exported.</p>
