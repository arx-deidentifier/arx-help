    <h4>Visualization of the solution space</h4>
    <p>In the center of the screen, the view displays a subset of the current solution space. The space may be
       visualized in different ways. First, it can be displayed as a Hasse diagram of the generalization lattice.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.5.0/img/exploration/explore_view_lattice.png" alt="Lattice view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>Here, each node represents a single transformation, which is identified by the generalization levels that it specifies for
       the quasi-identifiers in the input data set. Transformations are characterized by three different background
       colors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Green denotes that the transformation results in a privacy-preserving data set.</li>
        <li>Red denotes that the transformation does not result in an privacy-preserving data set.</li>
        <li>Orange denotes that the transformation is the optimal solution according to the specified utility measure.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Transformations that have not been pruned during the anonymization process are marked with a thick blue border. Dragging the
       mouse while holding the left button will move the current section of the solution space. Dragging the
       mouse while holding the right button will zoom in and out of the current view. Hovering the mouse over a
       transformation will display a tool tip with basic information about the transformation. Clicking a transformation
       with the left button will select it, while clicking a transformation with the right button will bring up a context
       menu. Here, transformations can either be applied to the current input data set or added to the clipboard.</p>
    <p>The solution space may also be visualized as a list.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.5.0/img/exploration/explore_view_list.png" alt="List view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>Here, each transformation is represented by one row. Rows are sorted by score. Data utility and
       the anonymity property are highlighted graphically. Thirdly, the solution space may be displayed as a set of tiles.</p>
    <img src="/help/v3.5.0/img/exploration/explore_view_tiles.png" alt="Tiles view" width="570" height="342" />
    <p>This view is very similar to the list described in the previous paragraph. The color and border of an element
       encodes information about the anonymity property, while the background color represents data utility. Elements
       are also ordered by their utility.</p>
