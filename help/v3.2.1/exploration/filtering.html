    <h4>Filtering the solution space (area 2)</h4>

    <p>The figure shows the controls for filtering the displayed subset of the solution space. First, a
        quasi-identifier can be selected and the displayed transformations can be limited to the ones defining given
        generalization levels for the selected quasi identifier. Second, the displayed transformations can be limited to
        anonymous or non-anonymous transformations. The sliders at the bottom allow to display only
        transformations with an information loss that is in between the configured minimum and maximum bounds. Note that
        the information loss of transformations that have not been checked explicitly are not known to the tool and that they are
        therefore estimated with bounding intervals that are computed from their successors and predecessors. 
        These intervals might be wrong when an approximate solution has been computed.</p>
